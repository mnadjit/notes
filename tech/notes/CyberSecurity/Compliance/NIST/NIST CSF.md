> NIST CSF: **National Institute of Standards and Technology - Cyber Security Framework**
# NIST CSF Components
1. Framework Core
	- Functions
		1. Identity
		2. Protect
		3. Detect
		4. Respond
		5. Recover
2. Implementation Tiers: 
	 - From 0 to 4
3. Profiles
	- A profile in each tier allows you to understand your current level of risk and figure out what steps to take next to tighten security. You can set up extra profiles, which give you targets to aim for and improve security as a whole online.

# NIST CSF vs ISO 27001
## Differences
- ISO 27001 is an international standard to improve an organization's information security **management systems**, while NIST CSF helps manage and **reduce cybersecurity risks** to their networks and data.

- NIST CSF is free, while ISO 27001 is not. [StrongDM Blog](https://www.strongdm.com/blog/nist-vs-iso#:~:text=If%20you%27re%20a%20new,and%20that%27s%20important%20to%20know.)

## Similarities
- They cover a lot of the same ground, such as identifying risks, implementing controls to reduce risk, and performance monitoring.
