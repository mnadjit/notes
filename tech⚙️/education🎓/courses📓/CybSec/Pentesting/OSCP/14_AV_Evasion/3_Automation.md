# Shellter
#Shellter #shell_code
[Shellter](https://www.shellterproject.com/) is a dynamic shell code injection tool and one of the most popular free tools capable of bypassing antivirus software. It uses a number of novel and advanced techniques to backdoor a valid and non-malicious executable file with a malicious shell code payload.
It performs a thorough analysis of the target PE file and the execution paths. It then determines where it can inject our shell code without relying on traditional injection techniques that are easily caught by AV engines. Those include *changing of PE file section permissions*, *creating new sections*, etc.
Attempts to use the existing [PE Import Address Table (IAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable#Import_Table) entries to locate functions that will be used for the memory allocation, transfer, and execution of our payload.

## Target selection hints

## Stealth mode
Stealth Mode will attempt to restore the execution flow of the PE after our payload has been executed.
In order to restore the execution flow through the Stealth Mode option, custom payloads need to terminate by exiting the current thread.
