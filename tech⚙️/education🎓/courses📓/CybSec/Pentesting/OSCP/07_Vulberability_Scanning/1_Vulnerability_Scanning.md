## CVE
**CVE** is used to *identify* a vulnerability.
## CVSS
**Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)** is a framework for addressing characteristics and *severity* of vulnerabilities.

## Backporting
#backport #backporting

The term backporting is used to describe the action of taking a fix for a security flaw out of the most recent version of an upstream software package and applying that fix to an older version of the package we distribute. For example, if a vulnerability is discovered for PHP 5.3 after it is end-dated, the distribution vendor would want to provide (backport) the fix to their customers, although it won't be provided by the PHP development team.
