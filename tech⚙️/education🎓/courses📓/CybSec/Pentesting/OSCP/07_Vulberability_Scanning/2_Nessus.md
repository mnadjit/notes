# Template types
1. Discovery
2. Vulnerabilities
3. Compliance

Plugins are written in **Nessus Attack Scripting Language** (NASL) #nasl that contain the information and the algorithm to detect vulnerabilities.

## General vulnerability scanning templates

1. The _Basic Network Scan_ performs a full scan with the majority of settings predefined. It will detect a broad variety of vulnerabilities and is therefore the recommended scanning template by Nessus. We also have the option to customize these settings and recommendations.
    
2. The _Advanced Scan_ is a template without any predefined settings. We can use this when we want to fully customize our vulnerability scan or if we have specific needs.
    
3. The last general scanning template, _Advanced Dynamic Scan_, also comes without any predefined settings or recommendations. The biggest difference between the two templates is that in the Advanced Dynamic Scan, we don't need to select plugins manually. The template allows us to configure a _dynamic plugin filter_ instead.

## Analyzing the scan results
#vpr #vulnerability_Priority_Rating
Analyzing the findings of a single target provides us with a lot of detailed information. However, we often want to get an overview of the most important vulnerabilities of all targets. To achieve this, Nessus provides a handy feature to get a prioritized overview of vulnerabilities named _VPR Top Threats_, which utilizes the _Vulnerability Priority Rating_ (VPR). The findings in the VPR list consist of the top ten vulnerabilities of the scan.
