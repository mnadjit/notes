# Client Fingerprinting
#client_fingerprinting
Let's assume we previously extracted an email address of a promising target with the tool [theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester). As a client-side attack we could use an HTML Application (HTA) attached to an email to execute code in the context of Internet Explorer and to some extent, Microsoft Edge. This is a very popular attack vector to get an initial foothold in a target's network and is used by many threat actors and ransomware groups.

## CanaryTokens
#canarytokens
https://canarytokens.org/generate
a free web service that generates a link with an embedded token that we'll send to the target. When the target opens the link in a browser, we will get information about their browser, IP address, and operating system.
This tool creates a URL, if opened in a browser shows a blank page, if used in an `img`  element, it shows a 1x1 image.
## Pretext
#pretext
A pretext frames a situation in a specific way. In a majority of situations, we can't just ask the target (a stranger) to click a link in an arbitrary email. Therefore, we should try to create context, perhaps by leveraging the target's job role.
