## proxy config
In Firefox, we can do this by navigating to about:preferences#general, scrolling down to Network Settings, then clicking Settings. Choose the Manual option, setting the appropriate IP address and listening port. In this case, the proxy (Burp) and the browser reside on the same host, so we'll use the loopback IP address 127.0.0.1 and specify port 8080. If the goal is to receive traffic from multiple machines, the external IP should be used instead of loopback address.

Why does "detectportal.firefox.com" keep showing up in the proxy history? A captive portal3 is a web page that serves as a sort of gateway page when attempting to browse the Internet. It is often displayed when accepting a user agreement or authenticating through a browser to a Wi-Fi network. 
To ignore this, simply enter about:config in the address bar. Firefox will present a warning, but we can proceed by clicking I accept the risk!. Finally, search for "network.captive-portal-service.enabled" and double-click it to change the value to "false". This will prevent these messages from appearing in the proxy history.
