# Types

## Reflected
#reflected #reflected_xss
usually include the payload in a crafted request or link. The web application takes this value and places it into the page content. This XSS variant only attacks the person submitting the request or visiting the link. Reflected XSS vulnerabilities can often occur in *search fields and results*, as well as *anywhere user input is included in error messages*.
## Stored / Persistent
#stored #persistent #stored_xss
when the exploit payload is stored in a database or otherwise cached by a server. The web application then retrieves this payload and displays it to anyone who visits a vulnerable page. A single Stored XSS vulnerability can therefore attack all site users. Stored XSS vulnerabilities often exist in *forum software*, especially in *comment sections*, in *product reviews*, or *wherever user content can be stored and reviewed later*.
## DOM-Based
#dom_based_xss #dom_based
DOM-based XSS can be **stored** or **reflected**
Takes place solely within the page's Document Object Model (DOM). This type of XSS occurs *when a page's DOM is modified with user-controlled values*. The key is that DOM-based XSS attacks occur when a browser parses the page's content and inserted JavaScript is executed.

# Outcome of XSS
- session hijacking
- forced redirection to malicious pages
- execution of local applications as that user
- trojanized web applications
