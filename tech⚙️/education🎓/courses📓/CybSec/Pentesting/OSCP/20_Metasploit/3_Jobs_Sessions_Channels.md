# Jobs
#job #jobs
- run a task in background (run as a job)
```msfconsole
run -j
```
# Sessions
#sessions #sessoin

- list sessions
```msfconsole
session -l
```

- switch to a session
```msfconsole
session -i <session_id>
```


# Channels
#channels #channel
if a session is suspended using `Ctrl+z` a channel is sent to background which can be used later.
so a session can have multiple channels. For example, if we want to have connections to different ports of the same target, we can have multiple channels in that session.
```msfconsole
channel -l
channel -i <channel_id>
```
