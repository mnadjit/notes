### Poodle

### Heartbleed
**Heartbleed** a security bug in some outdated versions of the OpenSSL cryptography library. It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014. Heartbleed could be exploited regardless of whether the vulnerable OpenSSL instance is running as a TLS server or client. It resulted from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension.
