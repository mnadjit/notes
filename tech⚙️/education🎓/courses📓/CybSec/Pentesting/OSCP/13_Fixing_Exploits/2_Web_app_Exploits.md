# Considerations

- Does it initiate an *HTTP* or *HTTPS* connection?
- Does it access a specific *web application path or route*?
- Does the exploit leverage a *pre-authentication vulnerability*?
- If not, how does the exploit *authenticate* to the web application?
- *HTTP methods*: How are the GET or POST requests crafted to trigger and exploit the vulnerability? Is there any HTTP method involved?
- Does it rely on *default application settings* (such as the web path of the application) that may have been changed after installation?
- Will oddities such as *self-signed certificates* disrupt the exploit?
