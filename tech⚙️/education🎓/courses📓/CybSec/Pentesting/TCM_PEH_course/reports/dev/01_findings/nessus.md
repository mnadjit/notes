# Basic
## Critical
**NFS Exported Share Information Disclosure**
At least one of the NFS shares exported by the remote server could be mounted by the scanning host. An attacker may be able to leverage this to read (and possibly write) files on remote host.

# Web App
## Medium
**Browsable Web Directories**
Multiple Nessus plugins identified directories on the web server that are browsable.

**PHP expose_php Information Disclosure**
The PHP install on the remote server is configured in a way that allows disclosure of potentially sensitive information to an attacker through a special URL. Such a URL triggers an Easter egg built into PHP itself.
Other such Easter eggs likely exist, but Nessus has not checked for them.
