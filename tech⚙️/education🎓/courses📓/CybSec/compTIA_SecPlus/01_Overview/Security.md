# CIA triad
1. Confidentiality
2. Integrity
3. Availability

# AAA of security
1. Authentication
	1. know (e.g. user/pass)
	2. are (e.g. face/voice recognition, retina scan)
	3. have (e.g. token)
	4. do (e.g. the way you talk or write your name)
	5. location
2. Authorization
3. Accounting
	1. Tracking of data (logging)

- Non-repudiation: proof that someone has done something like signed by a private key

# Threats
1. Malware
2. Unauthorized access
3. System failure
4. Social Engineering
	- e.g. by phishing

# Mitigations
1. Physical Control
2. Technical Control (smart card, encryption, ACLs, intrusion detection systems, network auth)
3. Adminstrative/Managerial Controls (Policies, procedures, seurity awareness training, contingency planning, disaster recovery plans)
	1. Procedural Controls: intra-organizational procedures
	2. Legal/Regulatory Controls: mandated by laws and regulations e.g. HIPPA in healthcare

# Hackers
1. **White** hats: employee of the organization
2. **Black** hats
3. **Gray** hats: no malicious intent, but still illegal
4. **Blue** hats: contractors/freelancers, e.g. hackerone (Bug Bounty programs)
5. **Elites**: First to find vulnarabilities, tool builders
	- Script kiddies: opposite of elites

# Threat Actors
1. Script Kiddies
2. Hacktivists
3. Organized crime
4. Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)

# Threat Intelligence and Sources
- Timeliness
- Relevancy
- Accuracy
- Confidence Levels

## Sources
1. Propietary
2. Closed-Source: e.g. FireEye
3. Open-Source

## Threat Feeds
1. US-Cert

## OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)
A way to collect information via social media

# Threat Hunting
1. Establishing hypothesis
2. Profiling threat actors and activities
3. Using SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), examples:
	- **ArcSight ESM (Enterprise Security Management)
	- AT&T Cybersecurity (formerly known as AlienVault)
	- Fortinet
	- IBM QRadar
	- McAfee SIEM
	- Splunk**

# Attack Frameworks
1. Lockheed Martin Kill Chain
2. MITRE ATT&CK Framework
3. Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis
