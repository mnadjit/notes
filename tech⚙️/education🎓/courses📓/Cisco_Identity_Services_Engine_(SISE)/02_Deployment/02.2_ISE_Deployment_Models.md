This training describes Cisco ISE nodes, personas, and roles along with various options for their deployment, and how the components communicate with each other.

# Cisco ISE Nodes and Personas

A Cisco ISE node is a running installation of the Cisco ISE software. The installation can be on a physical appliance, on a virtual machine within a supported hypervisor environment, or, as of version 3.1, Cisco ISE can be deployed from the cloud.

![[Pasted image 20230826161645.png]]

There are four major collections of Cisco ISE services that are organized into personas, each with different functions within the Cisco ISE Architecture. These personas include: the Administration persona, Policy Service persona, Monitoring persona, and pxGrid persona. Personas may be collocated on a single node or distributed across multiple nodes.

- **Administration persona:** This is the control center, the user interface for licensing and policy configuration. The Administration persona pushes configurations out to other nodes in a distributed deployment and is often referred to as the Admin node.
    
- **Policy Service persona:** This is the engine that processes all Cisco ISE-related network messaging: DHCP, Cisco Discovery Protocol, NetFlow, and RADIUS, among others. Nodes that implement this persona are referred to as Policy Service nodes.
    
- **Monitoring persona:** This is the engine for collecting and correlating logs and report data. It generates reports and alarms for the Cisco ISE system. Nodes that implement this persona are referred to as Monitoring nodes.
    
- **pxGrid persona:** This enables the sharing of contextual-based information from a Cisco ISE session directory to other network systems, such as Cisco Secure Firewall. You can use the pxGrid framework to exchange policy and configuration data between nodes. This data includes sharing tags and policy objects between Cisco ISE and third-party vendors for non-ISE related information exchanges, such as threat information. Use of the pxGrid service is available with the Advantage and Premier licenses.
    

# Nodes and Personas: Small Deployment

The initial state of a Cisco ISE node immediately after installation is standalone mode. In this mode, all personas run on a single Cisco ISE node. This deployment model lacks fault tolerance and has limited scalability. It has a maximum of 2000 endpoints, regardless of the physical hardware on which it runs.

![[Pasted image 20230826161709.png]]

For redundancy in a small deployment, a second node can be added. This is called a two-node deployment and the second node will be a secondary node for all personas. Therefore, the second node should have the same capacity as the primary node. While total capacity is not increased, both nodes can be used for RADIUS and TACACS+ functions, reducing the load on each individual node, and they are redundant for all network interactive services. Capacity is based on hardware type and licensing. If the primary node fails, the secondary node can be promoted to primary to reduce any down time for configuration and monitoring.

# Nodes and Personas: Four-Node Deployment

A distributed deployment, such as the four-node mode, improves fault tolerance and scalability. Distributed deployments introduce the concept of a role.

![[Pasted image 20230826161721.png]]

The Admin persona as a role is sometimes referred to as the Policy Administration Node (PAN). In this example, notice that one node has the primary role for the PAN. The other node serves in a secondary role for redundancy.

The Monitoring persona also has primary and secondary roles. To minimize inter-node communication overhead, it is a best practice to run the primary admin and monitoring personas on the same node and to run the secondary roles for both personas on the same node. A node running the Monitoring persona can be referred to as a Monitoring (MnT) node.

In this deployment, you improve scalability by separating a node that runs the Policy Service persona, referred to as a Policy Service Node (PSN), from the Admin and Monitoring nodes. When a node runs only the Policy Service persona, the maximum number of endpoints supported by that PSN depends upon the hardware platform.

> Note
> There is no concept of primary or secondary role with the Policy Service persona. Policy Service nodes play the role of RADIUS server to the network access devices (NADs) in the deployment. You may configure a particular NAD to assign a higher priority to one Policy Service node over another, but the Policy Service nodes themselves are unaware of the perspective of the NAD.

# Admin Node

The Admin node provides the administrator access to the configuration, administration, and operations of the Cisco ISE deployment.

![[Pasted image 20230826161736.png]]

There must be at least one Admin node in a Cisco ISE deployment. You can deploy a second Admin node for redundancy, but one node must have the primary role and the other the secondary role. Cisco ISE supports automatic failover for the Administration persona. If the PAN fails, Cisco ISE initiates an automatic promotion of the secondary Admin node. While the deployment of a secondary Admin node is not mandatory, it is a best practice.

The figure shows the login screen and administration user interface used to configure and manage the Cisco ISE solution. You create policy on the Admin node, but that policy is implemented on a Policy Service node.

# Policy Service Node

Policy Service nodes make real-time, policy-based decisions and convey the policies directly to the NADs for policy enforcement. The Admin node governs policy and the acquired endpoint attributes, but the Policy Service node is the Cisco ISE subsystem that supports runtime use cases, such as user and endpoint access. The other nodes support administrative, monitoring, or troubleshooting use cases.

![[Pasted image 20230826161748.png]]

The Policy Service node is responsible for all network interactions, including network access (such as AAA and RADIUS services), posture assessment, guest access, BYOD, profiling, and client provisioning.

Each Cisco ISE deployment can have one or more Policy Service nodes. As of Cisco ISE version 3.0, if the Administration and Monitoring personas run on the same node or pair of nodes, the deployment can have up to six separate Policy Service nodes. If the Administration and Monitoring personas are installed independently on their own nodes, the deployment can have up to 50 separate Policy Service nodes.

You can configure NADs to use redundant Policy Service nodes in their local configurations to provide fault tolerance. Large Cisco ISE deployments may also make use of Policy Service node groups, which require the addition of load-balancing systems to the deployment architecture. The Policy Service nodes belonging to a group can be Layer 2 adjacent or Layer 3 reachable. It is recommended that you make all the PSNs in the same local network and part of the same node group.

# Monitoring Node

The Cisco ISE Monitoring node is responsible for the monitoring of Cisco ISE components and related NAD activities. At least one Monitoring node is required; an optional secondary Monitoring node can be deployed for fault tolerance. When external logging is required, the Monitoring node can forward events to external repositories.

![[Pasted image 20230826161802.png]]

The Monitoring node is responsible for log collection, event correlation, and reporting.

The Monitoring node database hosts the session directory as a cache. A session directory is a run-time database of all current sessions that the Cisco ISE deployment is processing and tracking.

If more than one Monitoring node is deployed, both the active and standby Monitoring node instances will collect log messages. If the active Monitoring node instance fails, the standby Monitoring node instance automatically becomes the active Monitoring node instance. In the example, note that it is necessary that each PSN forwards information to both Monitoring nodes because the Monitoring nodes do not synchronize with each other.

Cisco ISE supports distributed log collection across all nodes to optimize local data collection, aggregation, and centralized correlation and storage. The Monitoring nodes can forward the logged information to external databases. The external log servers perform secure, long-term storage. They can act as sources for accounting and security-related information, providing useful evidence and forensics data.

A Collector agent process runs on each Cisco ISE node and collects data from the Cisco ISE software engines of each node. If a node runs the Policy Service persona, it will also collect logs from any NAD that is configured to send logs to it. The Collector agent buffers and transports the collected data to the designated monitoring nodes.

A collector process runs on the Monitoring nodes. The collector process receives data from the collector agents running on each of the Cisco ISE nodes in the deployment. The collector parses the data and inserts it into the Monitoring node database.

The Monitoring node database stores the MnT node-related log data locally. The Policy Service nodes send the information using the syslog protocol over UDP port 20514. If the deployment uses primary and secondary Monitoring personas, the information logs to both Monitoring nodes.

# pxGrid Services

Cisco pxGrid provides a type of information bus—a messaging highway to share context information with Cisco ISE ecosystem partners and other Cisco platforms. The pxGrid framework can exchange policy and configuration data between nodes.

![[Pasted image 20230826161816.png]]

Cisco ISE acts as the controller for the pxGrid. The controller establishes a grid instance, authenticates and authorizes clients, and maintains a directory of available context information “topics.” pxGrid is disabled by default and requires an Advantage license to deploy.

Cisco ISE must authenticate and authorize pxGrid clients to pxGrid. They can then register as a publisher to make information available to others, as a subscriber to request information from others, or both. Cisco ISE also registers to its own pxGrid as a publisher or subscriber or both.

A Cisco Secure Firewall and a Cisco Secure Web Appliance commonly use pxGrid to register with Cisco ISE. Cisco Secure Firewall access policies can now limit user access based on Active Directory group membership, for example. Cisco Secure Web Appliance might limit users from accessing certain websites based on context information it extracts from Cisco ISE.

Cisco ISE has all the who, what, how, when, and where context data if certain scenarios occur. For example, if an advanced GPS location-based system joins the grid, it may have detailed location information, but knows nothing about the applications, endpoints, and users. Or, a mobile device management (MDM) vendor product may join the grid with detailed information about whether an iPad has been “jailbroken” along with each device’s level of OS, patches, disk encryption, and virus protection. Since all these devices can share information across the grid, you have increased situational awareness and the ability to respond to and mitigate threats.

Third-party systems can quarantine users and devices in response to a network or security event. Cisco TrustSec scalable group tag (SGT) information is sharable with other networks. The endpoint profiles with fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) can pass from Cisco ISE to other networks through an endpoint profile meta topic. Cisco pxGrid also supports bulk downloads of SGTs and endpoint profiles.

In high-availability configurations, information replicates among Cisco pxGrid servers via the primary Admin node. When this node fails, pxGrid servers stop handling client registration and subscription. You must manually promote the primary Administration node for the pxGrid server to become active.

# Policy Synchronization

![[Pasted image 20230826161827.png]]

A common database is shared across all configured Administration and Policy Service nodes. When an administrator edits policy, the change synchronizes to all Cisco ISE nodes. Synchronization to the secondary Admin node ensures that it can fill the primary role if the current Admin node fails. Synchronization to the Policy Service nodes enables them to make runtime decisions with up-to-date policies.

# Deployment Options

As covered previously, the default mode for ISE when it is first deployed is standalone mode. This mode has all personas active on a single node and provides no redundancy in the event of a failure.

![[Pasted image 20230826161838.png]]

The smallest redundant Cisco ISE deployment, a split deployment, consists of two Cisco ISE nodes with one functioning as the primary appliance, which is suitable for small deployments. The primary node provides all configuration, authentication, and policy capabilities. The secondary node serves as a backup and maintains a functioning network upon primary node failure.

In split Cisco ISE deployments, you continue to maintain primary and secondary nodes as described in a small Cisco ISE deployment. However, the AAA load is split between the two Cisco ISE nodes to optimize the AAA workflow. Each Cisco ISE appliance (primary or secondary) must be able to handle the full workload in case problems arise. Neither the primary nor secondary node handles all AAA requests during normal network operations because the workload is distributed between the two.

As the network grows, you can add Cisco ISE nodes to create a medium-sized network. In medium-sized network deployments, you can dedicate the new nodes for all AAA functions and use the original nodes for configuration and logging functions.

It is best to use centralized logging for large Cisco ISE networks. To set up centralized logging, you must first set up a dedicated Monitoring persona. A dedicated Monitoring persona allows Cisco ISE to handle the potentially high syslog traffic that a large or busy network generates.

You can also instruct the appliances to send logs to both a Monitoring persona on the Cisco ISE node and a generic syslog server. Adding a generic syslog server provides a redundant backup if the Monitoring persona on the Cisco ISE node fails.

Because syslog messages are generated for outbound log traffic, any RFC 3164-compliant syslog appliance can serve as the collector for outbound logging traffic. A dedicated logging server enables you to use the reports and alert features in Cisco ISE to support all the Cisco ISE nodes.

# Cisco ISE Communication Model

So, how do the nodes of a Cisco ISE deployment interact to provide clients secure network access?

![[Pasted image 20230826161850.png]]

This figure illustrates communications between various Cisco ISE components. The figure represents logical communications because the nodes may or may not be running on the same appliance or virtual appliance:

1. The client is a device that is attempting to gain network access.
    
2. The client connects to a network access device (NAD)—a switch, wireless LAN controller (WLC), or firewall or VPN concentrator.
    
3. The client receives an authentication challenge request, which is sent by RADIUS to the PSN.
    
4. Using the configuration supplied by the Admin node, the PSN processes the client credentials. Then, based on policy compliance, the node makes an authorization decision.
    
5. The PSN may need to query some external identity source—a Microsoft Active Directory, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), or token server.
    
6. The PSN sends the decision to the NAD for enforcement via features such as VLANs, downloadable access control lists (dACLs), or scalable group tags (SGTs).
    
7. Based on the node’s decision, the client can traverse the NAD to the desired network resources.
    
8. All logging, such as syslog authentication exchange from the PSN, is sent to the Monitoring node for correlation and processing.
    
9. The Admin node is the Cisco ISE administrator’s window into the deployment while the Monitoring node performs and stores the logging function. You can view the logging information via the Admin node GUI. Similarly, while PSNs manage runtime policy operations, you view and configure these policies via the Admin node GUI.
