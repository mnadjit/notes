Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) has several feature licenses available, depending on your company size and needs. These licensing options have changed slightly over the years.

Many networks are transitioning from Cisco ISE versions 2.X to the newer 3.X versions. With these upgrades, or when installing a new version 3 deployment, it is important to know how the differences in licensing will affect your deployment.

This training identifies the Cisco ISE feature licensing options as well as many of the requirements to install Cisco ISE in your network.

# Cisco ISE 2.X Licensing

In Cisco ISE version 2.X, there are three tiers to network access licensing: Base, Plus, and Apex. In addition to the licenses affecting network access controls, there are also licenses needed for device management and installing Cisco ISE on virtual machines.

The Base license gives access to AAA, including RADIUS and 802.1X, EasyConnect, Cisco TrustSec and Scalable Group Access (SGA), multiple application programming interfaces (APIs), and Guest Services. The Base license is perpetual, meaning that once installed, it is active for the life of your deployment. The Base license needs to be installed for any Cisco ISE deployment prior to version 3.0.

The Plus license is a subscription-based license available in 1-, 3- or 5-year terms. It is installed in addition to the Base license to allow access to some of the advanced services that Cisco ISE provides. The Plus license is required for profiling, bring your own device (BYOD), pxGrid, Adaptive Network Control, and Mobility Service Engine (MSE) integration.

The Apex license is a subscription-based license also available in 1-, 3-, or 5-year terms. It is installed in addition to the Base license but is a separate license from the Base license. The Apex license gives Cisco ISE access to Posture Compliance, mobile device management (MDM) integration, Threat Centric Network Access Control (TC-NAC), AnyConnect Apex, and the ISE Posture Module.

The Device Admin license is required to give Cisco ISE access to the TACACS+ management options. This license was made available with the release of Cisco ISE version 2.0 as a perpetual license. While initially only a single license was required for the entire deployment, starting in version 2.4, each ISE node running the Device Admin service needs to have a license applied.

Prior to Cisco ISE version 2.4, virtual machines (VMs) were Right-to-Use and did not require special licensing to function. While you still needed your Base, Plus, or Apex license for services, the VM did not need a license to be installed or run. Beginning with version 2.4, VMs require a license tied to the amount of virtual resources they will consume, based on relative hardware equivalents. This license is perpetual and is available in small, medium, and large sizes. These sizes coordinate relative to the 3615, 3655, and 3695 Cisco Secure Network Server hardware on which ISE is available.

Cisco ISE licensing prior to version 3.0 offers two options to manage your licenses: Smart Licensing or Traditional Licensing.

Smart Licensing allows an administrator to monitor ISE software licenses and endpoint license consumption easily and efficiently with a single token registration. The licenses that you have purchased are maintained in a centralized database called the Cisco Smart Software Manager (Cisco SSM).

Traditional Licensing requires purchase and import of individual licenses based on your needs. These licenses manage the application features and access, such as the number of concurrent endpoints that can use Cisco ISE network resources.

# Cisco ISE 3.X Licensing

Starting with the Cisco ISE 3.0 release, you are required to have Smart Licensing, requiring that you create and configure a Cisco License Smart Account before you upgrade ISE or migrate your existing “classic” ISE licenses.

Cisco Smart Licensing helps you to easily procure, deploy, and manage licenses, allowing devices to self-register and report license consumption. This change removes the need for Product Authorization Keys (PAKs) and uses the Cisco Smart Software Manager (Cisco SSM) to obtain the necessary authorization.

With the 3.0 release, all Cisco ISE licenses are subscription-based, in 1-, 3-, or 5-year terms. The license tiers are stacked. While the tiers do match closely to the tiers of prior versions (Base matching Essentials, Plus matching Advantage, Apex matching Premier), you do not need to purchase each tier individually. By stacking the tiers, you only need to purchase the highest tier required and the lower tier functions are included. For example, when purchasing the Advantage license, you get the functions of Essentials, and when purchasing the Premier license, you get the functions of Essentials and Advantage.

# Cisco ISE 3.1 Virtual Machine Licensing

Beginning with Cisco ISE release 3.1, the VM licensing is available from the cloud, allowing you to scale your Cisco ISE deployments quickly and easily to meet changing business needs.

With release 3.1, you can extend the Cisco ISE policies in your home network to new remote deployments securely through AWS. There are three types of Cisco ISE instances in AWS and you can configure your Policy Administration Nodes (PANs) or Monitoring and Troubleshooting (MnT) nodes on these instances. Since you can select Cisco ISE instance types based on your own needs, Cisco does not offer multiple tiers with the Virtual Machine license.

You can use your existing Virtual Machine license unless you upgrade your ISE to 3.1 and later. If you upgrade your ISE to 3.1 and later, you need to migrate your VM Small, Medium, and/or Large license to the VM Common license. Once you migrate your VM license to the VM Common license, you can use the VM Common license even if you downgrade your ISE to 3.0 or earlier.

# VM OVA Templates

Cisco ISE offers several Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) templates that you can use to install and deploy Cisco ISE on virtual machines (VMs).

![[Pasted image 20230826162352.png]]

These OVA templates are configured with the required resource reservations based on the equivalent hardware matched in the template name. The 300 GB OVA templates are sufficient for Cisco ISE nodes that serve as dedicated Policy Service or pxGrid nodes. The 600 GB and 1.2 TB OVA templates are recommended to meet the minimum requirements for ISE nodes that run the Administration or Monitoring persona.

If you need to customize the disk size, CPU, or memory allocation, you can manually deploy Cisco ISE using the standard .iso image. However, it is important that you ensure the availability of the minimum requirements and resource reservations. The OVA templates simplify ISE virtual appliance deployment by automatically applying the minimum resources required for each platform.

# VM Provisioning and Disk IO Guidance

The Cisco ISE installation process ensures adequate disk I/O. If hard-drive I/O is low on your VM, you will receive a complaint message during installation and on the GUI dashboard. You may need to address the issue by moving the Cisco ISE node to a different host.

![[Pasted image 20230826162411.png]]

While thin provisioning is supported, thick provisioning is highly recommended, especially for the MnT. If you choose thin provisioning, operations such as upgrade, backup and restore, and debug logging, which require more disk space, might be impacted during initial disk expansion.

Note that hyper-threading is not required, but it can increase transactions per second.

As a guideline, the read performance should be at least 300 MB/second, with write performance of 50 MB/second or better.

Some ideas to achieve this level of performance are to use 10K RPM drives or better, enable caching on the Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) controller, enable RAID mirroring, and use RAID level 10, rather than RAID 5.

Be aware that many VM specialists will be tempted to disable resource reservations and oversubscribe. They will look at the resources reserved for Cisco ISE, compare these resources to resources that are currently in use, and believe that the reservations are too high. Lowering these reservations is a mistake and typically causes problems. These issues may not occur immediately, so those involved may not realize that these issues were caused by the change in reservations.
