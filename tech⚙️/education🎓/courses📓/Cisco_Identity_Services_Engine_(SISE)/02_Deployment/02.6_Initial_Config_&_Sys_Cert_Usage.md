The lab team has already run the install script on the system and installed Cisco ISE on the VMware server. You will verify the initial bootstrap of a Cisco ISE version 3.1 installation and the installation parameters and perform system certificate tasks.

The current configuration parameters include the following:

Enter hostname: **ise-1(should be lower case)**
Enter IP address: **10.10.10.30**
Enter IP netmask: **255.255.255.0**
Enter IP default gateway: **10.10.10.1**
Enter default DNS domain: **abc.public**
Enter primary name server: **10.10.4.20**
Enter NTP server: **192.168.123.1**
Enter system timezone: **UTC**
Enable SSH server? **Y**
Enter username: **admin**
Enter password: **1234QWer**

Additionally, the interface GigabitEthernet 1 has been configured with the IP address 10.10.40.30.

> Note
> Due to the size of the Cisco ISE databases, the lab may take 10-15 minutes to initialize. Please be patient.

Initialize

## Verify Cisco ISE Setup Using the CLI

In this task, you will familiarize yourself with the Cisco ISE console CLI by verifying the system setup. Cisco ISE has been partially preconfigured for you.

### Step 1

From the Admin-PC, open PuTTY and connect with SSH to Cisco ISE at the GigabitEthernet IP address of 10.10.10.30.

If you receive a PuTTY security alert that the server host key is not cached, select **Accept**.

### Step 2

At the login prompt, log in with the username **admin** and password **1234QWer**. When logged in, you will see this prompt: ise-1/admin#.

### Step 3

Show Me

Enter the command `show application status ise` and observe the status of each service. It may take several seconds for the output to display.

## Note

Some services may take a while before they start running, such as the Application Server, Certificate Authority Service, and perhaps others. It is OK if some services are not yet running; you can continue with this lab activity. However, the Application Server must be running before you can access the GUI interface in the following task.

### Step 4

Show Me

Verify NTP synchronization. At the command prompt, enter the command `show ntp`. What does the * at the beginning of the line indicate?

### Step 5

Show Me

Verify the DNS name resolution by entering the command `nslookup ise-1.abc.public`.

## Initial GUI Login and Familiarization

In this task, you will perform an initial login to the Cisco ISE administration interface and familiarize yourself with basic GUI navigation. You will explore each GUI menu item in more detail as you progress through other labs in this training.

### Step 6

Access your Admin-PC. If prompted, enter the username **admin** and password **1234QWer** to log in.

### Step 7

Show Me

To access the Cisco ISE administration interface, open a web browser and navigate to [https://ise-1.abc.public](https://ise-1.abc.public/), or click the browser toolbar shortcut that the lab team has provided.

If prompted, accept the Your Connection is Unsecure message and click **Add the Exception**. Then, click **Confirm Security Exception**.

### Step 8

Show Me

At the ISE login dialog box, log in with the credentials that were configured by the lab team during setup (username **admin** and password **1234QWer**).

If a “Click here to do a visibility setup” message appears, click **Do not show this again**.

### Step 9

Observe the Summary Dashboard.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Monolithic/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_DISCOVERY_Initial-GUI-Login-and-Familiarization_003.png)

When you first connect, you are viewing the Summary Dashboard. In later labs, you will configure other aspects of Cisco ISE, and these dashboards will populate and update accordingly. Because no devices or users are defined, many dashboards are empty.

### Step 10

Show Me

Click the menu button at the top of the page and navigate to **Context Visibility > Endpoints**. Explore the various submenus that are available. Do the same with the **Users** and **Network Devices** menus available under Context Visibility.

Context Visibility provides you with a more holistic view of the network, allowing for quick sorting and filtering of context information. You can view dashlets to get detailed informational data.

You can customize these dashboards and dashlets as you desire by clicking the triangle-shaped icon in the top-right corner to find and customize the available options. Keep in mind that these options change based on the currently viewed main menu heading, including Dashboard or Context Visibility.

### Step 11

Show Me

Select **Context Visibility > Endpoints**, click the **triangle** icon, and note the available options. Then, go to **Context Visibility > Users** and click the **gear** icon. Do the same for the **Network Devices** tab. You can see how the options change based on your current view.

You have the ability to add more dashboards to the Summary Dashboard page in two ways: Either click the + symbol to the right of the submenus, or click the **triangle** icon on the far right of the page (You may have to move your mouse slightly to the left of the icon to select it.). The + symbol only allows you to create a new dashboard and define its attributes. The triangle icon provides more options, such as adding more dashlets to the current view. You also can change the display layout and manage dashboards.

### Step 12

Show Me

Use either of the aforementioned methods to add a new test dashboard. Name the dashboard **MY_TEST** and click **Save**. Then, select two or three dashlet parameters to include with that dashboard. Click **Save**. You can now view this new dashboard; it appears as a submenu option on the Summary Dashboard.

Once your new dashboard is created, you have the ability to change parameters by selecting it from the Summary Dashboard and clicking the triangle icon. From here, you can perform such tasks as renaming the dashboard and adding more dashlets.

### Step 13

From the Summary Dashboard, click the **X** symbol next to the MY_TEST dashboard menu item to delete the dashboard. Click **OK** on the pop-up warning window.

### Step 14

Navigate to **Context Visibility > Endpoints** and click the **gear** icon on the right.

Observe the options to create new views or directly jump to a pre-existing dashboard. You will be able to customize these pages in later labs where appropriate.

### Step 15

Select the main menu button at the top left of the GUI and observe the other available menu options. You will access most of the configuration options available in much more detail as you move through this course.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Monolithic/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_DISCOVERY_Initial-GUI-Login-and-Familiarization_010.png)

The other options available from the main menu include the following:

- **Operations tab:** View live logs and live sessions, including RADIUS and TACACS+ sessions, and reports.
    
- **Policy tab:** Configure authentication and authorization, as well as profiling, provisioning, and posture. Briefly review Cisco ISE default policies for authentication, authorization, profiling, and provisioning. You will modify existing policies and add new policies in later labs.
    
- **Administration tab:** Perform system functions and identity management, and add network resources, device portals, and other Cisco ISE services.
    
- **Work Centers tab:** Work centers provide guided workflow processes for configuring various Cisco ISE services. Work centers also provide direct links to specific configuration pages. Take some time to click the various submenu options, and pay particular notice to the overview pages. These items help guide you through the Cisco ISE workflow process. For example, choose the **Overview** option under the headings for BYOD, Guest Access, or Network Access.
    

## Certificate Enrollment

By default, a Cisco ISE node is preinstalled with a self-signed certificate, which is used for EAP, Admin, portal, pxGrid, and Radius DTLS services. In a typical enterprise environment, this certificate is replaced with server certificates that are signed by a trusted CA.

You must establish system certificates on each deployment node for TLS-enabled authentication protocols such as EAP-TLS. Use these protocols for authenticating the Admin portal, for browser and REST clients to access the Cisco ISE web portals, and for the pxGrid service.

In this task, you will enroll Cisco ISE with the CA in your pod. You will download and install a certificate and generate a CSR. Finally, you will bind the CA-signed certificate to the CSR and then check its validity.

### Step 16

Using a web browser on the Admin-PC, open a new tab and navigate to your pod’s Microsoft Active Directory CA Server at [http://ad.abc.public/certsrv](http://ad.abc.public/certsrv). (There also may be a shortcut on the shortcut toolbar.)

If prompted, enter the username **administrator** and password **1234QWer**.

### Step 17
