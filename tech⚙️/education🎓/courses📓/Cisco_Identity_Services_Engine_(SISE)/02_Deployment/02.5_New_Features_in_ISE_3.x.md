Newer versions of the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) have introduced features, services, and installations that allow more integration of Cisco ISE into the network. Understanding newer features and options will allow you to take advantage of the capabilities that Cisco ISE offers.
# Cisco ISE Deployed in the Cloud
![[Pasted image 20230826163117.png]]

Deploying Cisco ISE in the cloud enables you to scale your Cisco ISE deployments quickly and easily to meet changing business needs. Cisco ISE is available as an infrastructure as code (IaC) solution, helping you to rapidly deploy network access and control services anywhere. You can install and launch Cisco ISE in Amazon Web Services (AWS) through CloudFormation templates (CFTs) or Amazon Machine Images. Cisco recommends using CFTs when deploying Cisco ISE in AWS.

CFTs are AWS solutions that allow you to easily create and manage cloud deployments. With CFTs, you can extend your network into the cloud by creating a virtual private cloud in AWS and configure a virtual private gateway to enable communication with your organization's network over an IPsec tunnel.

The figure shows Cisco ISE instances deployed in VPC subnets within the AWS Cloud. You can place common services such as certificate authority (CA), Active Directory, Domain Name System (DNS), and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers on premises or in AWS, based on the needs of your organization.

There are currently three Cisco ISE instances available for use within AWS: c5.4xlarge, m5.4xlarge, and c5.9xlarge. The c5.4xlarge and c5.9xlarge instances are recommended for the Policy persona and the m5.4xlarge instance is recommended for the Admin and MnT personas.

The performance features of the instances are as follows:

- c5.4xlarge has 16 CPU cores and 32 GB of RAM and has maximum active endpoint sessions of 40,000 when running as a dedicated PSN (10,000 if all three personas are deployed).
    
- c5.9xlarge has 36 CPU cores with 72 GB of RAM and has maximum active endpoint sessions of 100,000 when running as a dedicated PSN (25,000 if all three personas are deployed).
    
- m5.4xlarge can be a dedicated PAN or MnT and allows for a maximum of 500,000 active sessions for the distributed cluster per deployment.
    

If you are new to Cisco ISE and want to evaluate Cisco ISE features, you can use the evaluation instance, t3.xlarge. In evaluation mode, Cisco ISE supports 100 endpoints and allows you access to all Cisco ISE features for a period of 90 days. This evaluation instance only has 4 CPU cores and 16 GB RAM and would not be suitable for a production environment, but would be a way to familiarize yourself with Cisco ISE before deployment within a live environment.

# Azure Integration for Admin Access

Microsoft Azure Active Directory is an entirely cloud-based identity and access management service. Many organizations take advantage of Azure Active Directory as a single place to manage single sign-on (SSO), multifactor authentication (MFA), conditional access, and other authentication methods. Beginning with Cisco ISE version 3.1, integration with Azure Active Directory has been extended to administrator access to the ISE administration GUI.

![[Pasted image 20230826163154.png]]

The figure shows a high-level workflow of an Administrator login to the Cisco ISE admin portal using Azure Active Directory for SSO access. The workflow is as follows:

1. The administrator uses a web browser to connect to the Cisco ISE admin portal GUI using HTTPS.
    
2. From the initial login page, the administrator chooses the option “Log in With SAML”.
    
3. Cisco ISE issues an HTTP 302 redirect message, directing the user to the Microsoft authentication on the Azure Active Directory, where the administrator logs in using their Active Directory credentials.
    
4. After a successful login to the SSO portal, the user has appropriate access to the Cisco ISE admin GUI.
    

The identity provider, Azure Active Directory, is the authority that verifies and asserts a user's identity and access privileges to a requested resource (the service provider). The service provider is the hosted resource or service that the user intends to access, the ISE Application Server in this case. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard that allows the identity provider to pass authorization credentials to the service provider.

SAML enables a user to access multiple web applications using a single set of credentials. SAML works by passing information about users, logins, and attributes between the identity provider (Azure Active Directory) and the service provider (ISE). Using an SSO, each user logs in once with the identity provider, then the Azure Active Directory provider passes the SAML attributes to ISE when the user attempts to access its services. ISE requests authorization and authentication from Azure Active Directory.

SAML transactions use XML for standardized communications between the identity provider and service providers. SAML is the link between the authentication of a user’s identity and the authorization to use a service.

# Multi-DNAC Support

In Cisco ISE releases prior to version 3.0, a single deployment of Cisco ISE could integrate with only a single Cisco Digital Network Architecture Center (DNAC) deployment. Therefore, although a Cisco ISE deployment can scale up to two million endpoints, prior to release version 3.0, ISE’s DNAC support was limited by DNAC’s single deployment maximum of 25 to 100 thousand endpoints.

Beginning with release 3.0, the multi-DNAC feature of Cisco ISE for the Access Control app in Cisco DNA Center allows you to integrate up to four Cisco DNA Center clusters with a single Cisco ISE system, significantly increasing the number of supported endpoints.

# API Gateway

Cisco ISE API gateway is an application programming interface (API) management solution that acts as a single entry point to multiple Cisco ISE Service APIs to provide better security and traffic management.

![[Pasted image 20230826163229.png]]

API requests from external clients are routed to the API Gateway in Cisco ISE. Based on an internal algorithm, the requests are forwarded to the Cisco ISE nodes where service APIs are running.

In Cisco ISE Release 3.0 the Monitoring (MnT) API is routed through the API Gateway.

You can choose the Cisco ISE nodes on which you want to enable the API Gateway. Cisco recommends that you run the API Gateway on at least two nodes in your Cisco ISE deployment.

# Additional New Features

Several other features were added to Cisco ISE in version 3.X. Some of these are completely new features that make administration and integration into your security architecture a better experience and some are updates to existing features that improve usability and streamline management.

![[Pasted image 20230826163246.png]]

Some of these new and updated features include:

- **Zero-Touch Provisioning:** Zero-Touch Provisioning (ZTP) refers to the uninterrupted provisioning mechanism. It automates Cisco ISE installation, patching, hot patching, and infrastructure service enablement without manual intervention. Enabled in Cisco ISE 3.1, this feature can be leveraged by mapping an .img file to automate virtual machine (VM) installations with mandatory parameters (hostname, IP address, IP netmask, IP default gateway, DNS domain, primary name server, NTP server, system timezone, SSH, username, and password), or by using VM user data, which adds optional parameters (IPv6, patch, hot patch, services, and repository details) for the VM.
    
- **Open API service:** OpenAPIs are REST APIs based on HTTPS operating over port 443. APIs are now available in the OpenAPI format for use with Cisco ISE. Beginning with Cisco ISE version 3.1, the Repository Management, Configurations Data Backup and Restore, Policy Management (RADIUS and TACACS+), and Certificate Management OpenAPIs are available.
    
- **Posture Script Remediation:** You can create and upload posture remediation scripts into Cisco ISE to solve non-compliance issues in endpoints.
    
- **Posture support for Linux:** Posture is a service in Cisco ISE that allows you to check the state of all the endpoints that are connecting to a network for compliance with corporate security policies. Cisco ISE 3.1 supports the following Linux operating system versions, in addition to Windows and Mac operating systems:
    
    1. **Ubuntu:** 18.04 and 20.04
        
    2. **Red Hat:** 7.5, 7.9, 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3
        
    3. **SUSE:** 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 15.0, 15.1, and 15.2
        
- **Upgrade Options:** In the Administration > System > Upgrade> Upgrade Selection window, you can choose between a Full upgrade and a Split upgrade:
    
    1. **Full upgrade:** A Full upgrade is a multistep process to enable a complete upgrade of your Cisco ISE deployment sequentially. This process upgrades all the nodes in parallel and in less time compared to the split upgrade process. Because all the nodes are upgraded in parallel, services will be down during the upgrade process.
        
    2. **Split upgrade:** A Split upgrade is a multistep process that enables the upgrade of your Cisco ISE deployment while allowing services to remain available to users during the upgrade process. With the split upgrade option, you will be able to choose the nodes to be upgraded.
        
- **Context Visibility Enhancements:** In the Export Endpoints dialog box, you can now check the Importable Only check box if you want to export only the attributes that can be imported into Cisco ISE without any modification to the CSV file. Using this option prevents the need to modify the columns or metadata in the exported CSV file before importing it to Cisco ISE. Additionally, while using the Quick Filter or Advanced Filter option, you can use the Export Filtered option to export only the filtered endpoints.
    
- **Authorization Result Alarms:** You can configure alarms based on the results of authorization policies. This feature allows you to monitor the impact of any networking, infrastructure, or application changes on endpoint authorizations. You can define the scope of your alarms by choosing specific Network Device Groups (NDGs). For each NDG you choose, a new Authorization Result alarm is created.
