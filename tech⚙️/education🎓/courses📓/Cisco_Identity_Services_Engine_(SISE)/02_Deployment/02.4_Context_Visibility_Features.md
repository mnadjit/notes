This training introduces the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Context Visibility features. Upon completion, you will be able to describe the Context Visibility feature, understand its use, and explain the advantages that it offers to administration and troubleshooting tasks.

# Context Visibility Features

Context Visibility provides you with a more holistic network view of endpoints, users, compliance, and more. An interactive user interface allows you to quickly sort and filter context information to see the most relevant information and improve your situational awareness.

Context Visibility lets you view almost all information related to endpoints with user-friendly charts, customizable columns, and customizable dashlets. A dashlet is a small window on a dashboard that contains information about a category such as a set of attributes and a chart of information about those attributes.

Within the Context Visibility tab, you have a quick and easy way to identify the various users and endpoints on your network. When you choose the Endpoints option, you start with an endpoint authentication overview with several selectable dashlets. The dashlets have drill-down capability. Selecting one of the items in the dashlet creates a filter for the table shown below the dashlets. This feature allows for quick and easy sorting of the entries in the table to find anomalies and troubleshoot issues. You can choose any dashlet to drill down into more detailed graphs and tabular data.

Context Visibility also offers a simple wizard to improve your network visibility into connected users and endpoints. The customizable dashboard lets you decide which data displays and shows it all in one place. You can also define user-based views for even greater customization.

Context Visibility features make it easier for you to find endpoint compliance issues or behavior anomalies, improving network security. For example, the application dashboard lets you quickly perform a comparative analysis of the number of endpoints with a specific application installed. The results display in graphical and tabular format for easy export to a spreadsheet. Applications are classified into 14 categories. Applications that do not fit into these categories are termed Unclassified.

# Context Visibility Data Sources

Cisco ISE has many sources for contextual data that is collected about endpoints. With the Advantage license, Cisco ISE can use probes to collect data from many processes that are already running on the network. Probes can collect data about endpoints from protocols such as DHCP, HTTP, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), and others. This data is then added to the context database.

Administrators can manually run processes to add to the data collection for endpoints about which probes do not collect sufficient contextual data. From the Profiler work center, an administrator can manually run a Network Mapper (Nmap) against endpoints on the network to try and determine the endpoint OS. Administrators can also load and run scripts against endpoints to determine the OS and the applications that are currently running.

The Advantage license also gives Cisco ISE the Platform Exchange (Cisco pxGrid) persona. By enabling pxGrid, Cisco ISE can exchange data with other security and management platforms on the network. Many of these platforms will provide contextual data, including location services, compromised endpoints, threat and vulnerability information, and other data. Cisco ISE can also share the contextual data that it collects with these other platforms.

With many sources of contextual data available, the Context Visibility menu in Cisco ISE makes it easier to identify anomalies, security violations, and compliance issues on the network.
