## Guest Use Case
Supporting various types of access, such as guest or contractor, while also improving network security is a challenging endeavor.

![Guest Use Case](Cisco_ISE_Guest_Use_Case.png)

- Common guest use cases that Cisco ISE provides: 
	- Hotspot access: no credentials needed
	- Self-Registered Guest Access: through a portal
	- Full-Sponsored Access: a role-based access that requires an employee to act as a sponsor to provide guests or contractors with internet or other types of access

## BYOD Use Case
![BYOD Use Case](Cisco_ISE_BYOD_Use_Case.png)
## Profiling Use Case
- To create a complete inventory of which devices access your network—printers, smart phones, tablets, laptops, IP cameras, and other devices.
- ability of Cisco ISE to perform device profiling + typical authentication and authorization services. SISE analyzes endpoint network traffic characteristics to identify device types and operating systems, to develop advanced authorization policies, such as imposing a policy that prevents smart phone users from accessing financial data.

## Compliance Use Case
- Do devices have latest operating system version, software, patches, and virus protection?
- Cisco Posture services can perform various *software* and *operating system* checks. For *non-compliant* devices
- Remediation actions to increase network security and control. 
- integrate with MDM

## Device Administration with TACACS+ Use Case
- SISE has always supported end user and endpoint authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) using the RADIUS protocol
- RADIUS is *NOT optimal* for supporting *administrative access to network devices* such as switches, routers, and firewalls
- TACACS+ is more suitable for controlling administrative device access, so before, Cisco Secure Access Control Server (Cisco Secure ACS) was used for administrative access.
- with SISE 2.0 there is support for TACACS+, so no need for Cisco Secure ACS
- SISE can be a single, centralized policy engine to support both *end user access to network resources* and *administrative access to network devices*

## Context Exchange with pxGrid Use Case
 - SISE maintains contextual info about connection sessions
	 - who
	 - what
	 - how
	 - where
	 - when
- pxGrid (Cisco Platform Exchange Grid) provides *a secure communication framework* to share *context information* with *Cisco ISE Ecosystem partners* and *other Cisco platforms*. 
- SISE acts as *the controller* to **authenticate** and **authorize** Cisco pxGrid clients
	- e.g. Cisco Secure Firewall can register as a client and gain access to user/endpoint identity information. Thus, it can limit user access based on Active Directory group membership (the contextual who)
	- or an MDM product 

## Threat-Centric Network Access Control Use Case
- SISE access policies are relatively static—they are not dynamically adjusted based on threats.
- **TC-NAC** (Threat-Centric Network Access Control) enables you to create authorization policies *based on threat and vulnerability attributes* that Cisco ISE receives from threat and vulnerability adapters.
- supported vulnerability adapters which can send info e.g. *Indications of Compromise*, *Threat Detected events*, and *Common Vulnerability Scoring System scores* to Cisco ISE:
	- SourceFire FireAMP
	- Cognitive Threat Analytics adapter
	- Qualys
	- Rapid7 Nexpose
	- Tenable Security Center

## Software Defined Segmentation Use Case
- SISE uses *SGA* (Scalable Group Access) for granular access policies based on *device type*, *host*, or *user*
- scalable group access abstracts business units or group from the IP addressing scheme, independent of network topology

## Software-Defined Access Use Case
- SISE, a centralized policy engine, integrates with various identity stores
- Integrates *via pxGrid* with other platforms like *Cisco Digital Network Architecture (Cisco DNA)* with *Cisco Software-Defined Access (SD-Access).
- Cisco DNA architecture:
	- allows quickly and consistently *design new networks*, *reprovision existing networks*, and *create policy for those networks*
	- *provision network devices with that policy*, along with automated device image management
	- complete *monitoring* from a *single GUI interface*

## Cisco Digital Network Architecture
The need for secure, zero-trust networking is growing as campus networks become more distributed and offsite IT teams become the norm. Network management needs to have more extensive control and optimization. Having a network environment that can be managed from a single dashboard will help you optimize your Cisco investment, secure your remote workforce, and lower your IT spending.

- GUI-based Cisco DNA Center provides four key functions:
	1. **Design:** use Cisco DNA Center to design a network and push down the info to actual network devices in a more automated way.
	2. **Policy:** build virtual networks for *user segmentation*, *access control policies*, and *application priority schemes* for quality of service (*QoS*) policy. For security, Cisco DNA uses *TrustSec* and scalable group tags (*SGT*). You create virtual networks, which create virtual routing instances on your Layer 3 devices called *virtual route forwarding (VRF)* entities. You can then associate various users, endpoints, and groups to these entities to control who can do what. This group/entity information is pulled from Cisco ISE.
	3. **Provisioning:** 
		- Design and Policy, can be performed before deploying or even purchasing your equipment. 
		- All previous addressing, operating system image, WLAN, and security efforts can be pushed down to the Fabric devices. To facilitate this push, you create logical fabrics. These logical fabrics are often geographically based. You place icons representing your actual hardware into these fabrics. This provisioning function contains information similar to the information from the many Cisco Validated Design documents.
	1. **Assurance:** This function provides for monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities.

- SISE integration into Cisco DNA: 
	- allows dynamic mapping of users and devices to scalable groups which simplifies security policy management and enforcement, and is more scalable
	- via Cisco pxGrid and REST APIs to exchange client information and automate fabric-related configurations on ISE. 
	- SGTs are centrally defined, managed, and administered by Cisco ISE.
