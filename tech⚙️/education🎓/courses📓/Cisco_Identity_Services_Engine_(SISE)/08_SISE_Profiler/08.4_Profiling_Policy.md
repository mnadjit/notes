With the help of the Cisco Profiler feed service, the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) profiling service assigns profiled devices to certain endpoint identity groups.

This training describes how to assemble profiling components into a logical, functional profiling service and the use of profiling logic, profiling without probes, and how profiling interacts with change of authorization (CoA).
# Profiling Policy Overview

Cisco ISE collects data about endpoints and other devices connected to the network from sources that are called probes. This data is stored in the ISE database and associated with endpoints as endpoint attributes. Attributes are processed via a profiling policy to find a matching profile.

![[Pasted image 20230903133517.png]]

Profiling policies will match an endpoint profile to each MAC address in the endpoint database in a best-match method based on policy priority. Additionally, ISE can categorize endpoints into endpoint identity groups that can be used for matching authorization policies for network access.

As the ISE profiling service uses attributes to identify types of devices, it assigns a value called a certainty factor to each device. This certainty factor is an indication of how sure Cisco ISE is of the identity of the device. The higher the number, the more confident ISE is of accurately identifying the device.

An example of the profiling process is as follows:

- If the certainty factor equals at least 20, then profile the device as an iPad.
    
    1. If the user-agent attribute contains “iPad”, then increase the certainty factor by 20.
        
    2. If the host-name attribute contains “iPad”, then increase the certainty factor by 20.
        

Conditions and policies can be modified to meet organizational needs. As new devices are added to the environment, conditions can be created based on the attributes available, and then added to policies to ensure that the correct endpoint policy is applied. If the endpoint is matching the wrong endpoint policy, policies can be altered to ensure that endpoints are matched to the correct one.

# Profiling Flow Example

The following figure demonstrates how the ISE profiling components interact. As Michelle connects to the network with her iPad, Cisco ISE probes collect information about the device, including the DHCP host-name attribute, which contains the value “iPad”.

![[Pasted image 20230903133530.png]]

Cisco ISE contains many predefined profiling conditions, two of which are represented in the figure. For example, the condition named Apple-iPadRule1Check1 is focused on whether the user-agent attribute (often contained in HTTP responses) contains the string “iPad”. The condition named Apple-iPadRule2Check2 is focused on whether the DHCP host-name attribute contains a value of “iPad”.

In the example shown in the figure, Cisco ISE will be convinced that the discovered device is actually an iPad if the certainty factor equals at least 20 – the minimum certainty factor for this profiler policy. If either of the conditions are met, the certainty factor will be increased by a value of 20. In this case, the second condition matched, and therefore, Michelle’s device is determined to be an iPad.

The profiling policy’s minimum certainty metric is used to evaluate the matching profile for an endpoint. During profiling, endpoint attributes might match one or more rules in a policy. The certainty metric for all valid rules is cumulative, and therefore, each matching rule increases the profiler’s categorization certainty. This number must exceed the minimum certainty factor that is defined in an endpoint profiling policy for a device to be categorized. By default, the minimum certainty factor for all new profiling policy rules and predefined profiling policies is 10.

To see all the predefined conditions in Cisco ISE, navigate to **Work Centers > Profiler > Policy Elements > Profiler Conditions**.

![[Pasted image 20230903133558.png]]

From the Profiler Conditions page, you will find an extensive list of conditions, organized alphabetically. These conditions can be used to identify many endpoints, from 2-wire devices to Zebra printers. If these predefined conditions do not suit your needs, you can modify them or create your own.

The preceding figure shows the three conditions relevant to the Apple iPad example. These conditions are used in a predefined profiler policy named Apple-iPad.

![[Pasted image 20230903133623.png]]

As shown in the figure, the Apple-iPad policy is enabled, and the minimum certainty factor is 20. Near the bottom of the figure, note that the conditions are applied, and that upon a match, the certainty factor will be increased by the specified value of 20 for each of the conditions. Based on this configuration, if any of the conditions are matched, the endpoint will meet the minimum certainty factor for this policy.

It is possible that an endpoint can match on more than one profiler policy. If this happens, the matched policy with the highest certainty factor will be applied. For example, in addition to matching the Apple-iPad profiler policy as shown, an iPad device would also match the generic Apple-device profiler policy, which has a certainty factor of 10. Since the Apple-iPad’s policy certainty factor of 20 is higher than the generic Apple-device policy’s 10, the Apple-iPad profiler policy would be applied.

As with conditions, if the predefined profiling policies do not suit your needs, you can modify them or create your own. These endpoint profiling policies contain a single condition or a combination of multiple conditions. These conditions are logically combined using Boolean AND or OR operators. Therefore, you have flexibility when checking, categorizing, and grouping endpoints for a given rule into a policy.

# Logical Profiles

When an endpoint matches a profiler policy, it is assigned that policy name as its endpoint profile, and it can be added to an identity group.

![[Pasted image 20230903175459.png]]

When connected devices are profiled into specific endpoint identity groups, it increases your situational awareness—you know which device types are connected, where they are connected, and who is using them.

You can use the identity group that the endpoint is assigned to as the match criteria for an authorization policy, but in many cases, this would not be the best match for your environment. For example, the preceding figure shows the matched policy for an iPad called Apple-iPad. The match is very specific for an iPad, but the identity group that is assigned to the endpoint is the parent group called Apple-Device. This parent group is a generic group that matches all Apple devices based on the OUI in the MAC address. If you were building an authorization policy based on this identity group, all Apple devices, not just iPads, would match this policy, and that outcome may not be what you desire.

Another way to handle authorization policy matches is to create logical profiles that enable you to organize endpoints in a way that works better for your organization.

![[Pasted image 20230903175518.png]]

For example, perhaps your company prefers that Apple iPads, Microsoft Surface tablets, and Samsung Galaxy tablets be used on your network. Follow these steps:

1. Create a logical profile named Smart Devices. If a connected device profiled as an Apple-iPad, Microsoft-Surface-Tablet, or Android-Samsung-Galaxy Tablet, it will be a member of the Smart Devices logical profile.
    
2. Create an authorization policy named Smart Devices. The Smart Devices logical profile is referenced in the condition of the authorization policy named Smart Devices. If the Endpoints-LogicalProfile equals Smart Devices, the result is that an authorization profile named Smart Devices Access shall be applied.
    

# Cisco ISE Profiler and CoA

When network access devices (NADs) support change of authorization (CoA), the profiler service can push tailored authorization policies to endpoints. Endpoints authenticate and get a restrictive authorization policy—enough for sensing traffic to be exchanged. Cisco ISE determines the endpoint profile and then sends a CoA to the NAD. This authorization change instructs the NAD to apply an adjusted policy.

![[Pasted image 20230903175546.png]]

The ISE Profiler can be deployed with or without CoA. CoA is not absolutely necessary for profiler service operation and is not enabled by default. If some NADs in your network do not support CoA, you can still deploy the profiler service for endpoint monitoring and use the profiler service to establish a learned inventory.

The profiler service implements CoA when some activity makes a new policy profile more appropriate. These CoA-causing activities include the following:

- Static assignment of an endpoint
    
- Configuration of exception action
    
- First-time profiling of an endpoint
    
- Deletion of an endpoint
    
- Change to an applied endpoint profile or identity group
    
- Change to an endpoint profiling policy that is used in an authorization policy
    

If you have enabled CoA, the best practice is to enable the RADIUS probe in conjunction with your CoA configuration in Cisco ISE. The profiler service can then issue an appropriate CoA for endpoints by using collected RADIUS attributes.

> Note
> If you have disabled the RADIUS probe, you can rely on the monitoring persona REST API to issue CoAs. This functionality allows the profiler service support a wider range of endpoints without requiring the support of the RADIUS probe.

![[Pasted image 20230903175623.png]]

CoA can be defined as part of the endpoint profiling policy or applied globally. Each policy can be configured to use the global settings or can be configured with its own CoA policy that is applied when the policy is matched. Since there are hundreds of profiling policies configured in Cisco ISE and modifying each of them would be a time-consuming operation, a more efficient approach is to use a global CoA policy and then change the individual CoAs on any conflicting endpoint Profiler policies.

The available CoA options include the following:

- **No CoA (default):** Use this option to disable the global configuration of CoA.
    
- **Port Bounce:** Use this option if switch ports will have only one session (one active endpoint attached). If ports shall have multiple sessions, then use the Reauth option.
    
- **Reauth:** Use this option to enforce reauthentication as appropriate for profiled endpoints.
    

If you have multiple active sessions on a single port, the profiling service issues a CoA with the Reauth option. The profiling service issues the CoA even if you have configured CoA with the Port Bounce option. This functionality avoids disconnecting other sessions, a situation that might occur with the Port Bounce option.

# Default Endpoint Identity Groups

|Endpoint Identity Group|Description|
|---|---|
|RegisteredDevices|For devices registered through the device registration portal|
||The profiling service continues to profile these devices normally|
||Static assignment, no dynamic reassignment|
||You can edit, delete, and block these devices|
|GuestEndpoints|Endpoints used by guest users|
|Blocked List|Statically assigned to endpoints that should be restricted|
|Profiled|Contains endpoints that Cisco ISE has profiled. This group has multiple associated endpoint identity groups.|
|Unknown|Group for endpoints that do not match a profile|

By default, a Cisco ISE deployment offers these five endpoint identity groups:

- **RegisteredDevices:** This endpoint identity group includes endpoints, which are registered devices, added by an employee through the device registration portal. The profiling service continues to profile these devices normally when they are assigned to this group. Endpoints are statically assigned to this group in Cisco ISE, and the profiling service cannot reassign them to any other identity group. These devices will appear like any other endpoint in the endpoints list. You can edit, delete, and block these devices from the endpoints list in the Endpoints page of the ISE Admin portal. Devices that you block in the device registration portal are assigned to the Blacklist endpoint identity group. An authorization profile in Cisco ISE redirects the blocked devices to a URL, which displays “Unauthorized Network Access”, a default portal page to the blocked devices.
    
- **GuestEndpoints:** This endpoint identity group includes endpoints that are used by guest users.
    
- **Blacklist:** This endpoint identity group includes endpoints that are statically assigned to endpoints in Cisco ISE and grouped within the Blacklist identity group.
    
- **Profiled:** This endpoint identity group includes endpoints that are profiled by Cisco ISE and grouped within the Profiled endpoint identity group. This identity group has multiple associated endpoint identity groups.
    
- **Unknown:** This endpoint identity group includes endpoints that do not match a profile.
    

# Profiler Feed Service

Cisco provides most of the Profiler conditions and policies that will be used to configure profiling. Many of the conditions and policies rely on up-to-date information about endpoints that might connect to your network, such as their OUIs and other attribute data.

The Profiler feed service downloads published OUIs and profile definitions to Cisco ISE. It also provides an approval and publishing process, if that is needed within your environment. The feed service includes a configurable daily schedule, it can be immediately run with the “Update Now” feature, or it can be performed manually offline. There are also reports that you can observe to review the update history.

![[Pasted image 20230903175920.png]]

Profiler conditions, exception actions, and Network Mapper (Nmap) scan actions are classified as either Cisco-provided or administrator-created. Classifications can be seen in the System Type attribute for these entities.

You cannot edit or delete Cisco-provided conditions, exception actions, and Nmap scan actions. You cannot delete endpoint policies that are provided by Cisco. When you edit policies, they are considered as administrator-modified.

You can retrieve new and updated endpoint profiling policies and the updated OUI database from a designated Cisco feed server through a subscription in Cisco ISE. You can send subscriber information back to Cisco to maintain records, which are treated as privileged and confidential. Additional subscriber information is provided to receive email notifications for applied, success, and failure messages.

The Profiler feed service is disabled by default and requires an Advantage or higher license to enable it. When you enable the service, Cisco ISE downloads the feed service policies and OUI database updates every day at 1:13 a.m. UTC. Cisco ISE automatically applies these downloaded feed server policies.

The Profiler feed service updates have the following provisions:

- Cisco-provided (default) policies are overwritten.
    
- Administrator-created or administrator-modified policies (custom) profiles are preserved.
    
- Cisco ISE also stores the set of changes so that you can revert these changes back to the previous state. When you revert from the set of changes that you last applied, newly added endpoint profiling policies are removed, updated endpoint profiling policies revert to the previous state, and the profiler feed service is also automatically disabled.
    

If you want to revert any administrator-modified endpoint profiling policy to any Cisco-provided endpoint profiling policy, you must delete the administrator-modified endpoint profiling policy. Alternatively, you may revert the administrator-modified endpoint profiling policy to the previous Cisco-provided endpoint profiling policy.

The designated Cisco feed server downloads the updated OUI database from [http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/oui/oui.txt](http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/oui/oui.txt), which is the list of vendors that are associated to the MAC OUI. The updated database is available for any Cisco ISE deployment as a feed that Cisco ISE downloads to its own database. Cisco ISE updates endpoints and then starts reprofiling endpoints.

> Note
> The designated Cisco feed server is located at [https://ise.cisco.com:8443/feedserver/feed/](https://ise.cisco.com:8443/feedserver/feed/).

# Profiler Work Center

The Profiler Work Center menu (**Work Centers > Profiler**) of the ISE Admin portal contains all the Profiler configuration pages and is considered the starting point to administer Cisco ISE profiling.

![[Pasted image 20230903180002.png]]

From the Profiler Work Center menu, you can configure the profiling service to run on a single Cisco ISE node that assumes all Administration, Monitoring, and Policy Service personas. In a distributed deployment, the profiling service runs only on Cisco ISE nodes that assume the Policy Service persona. The profiling service does not run on Cisco ISE nodes that only assume the Administration and/or Monitoring personas.

# Profiler Dashboard

The Profiler dashboard (**Work Centers > Profiler > Endpoint Classification**) is a centralized monitoring tool for the profiles, endpoints, and assets in your network.

![[Pasted image 20230903175952.png]]

The dashboard represents data in both graphical and table formats, and it includes the following dashlets:

- **Endpoints dashlet:** Displays the endpoint profiles or logical profiles that have been matched with the profiler service.
    
- **Endpoint Categories dashlet:** Displays the OUI, Operating Systems (OS Types), and Identity groups that have been matched with the profiler services connected endpoint identity groups, Policy Service Nodes (PSNs), and OS types.
    
- **Network Devices dashlet:** Displays information about where endpoints were discovered in your environment, including the location, network device type, and the device name that endpoints are connected to.
    

The table displayed below the dashlets categories profiling and authentication data about endpoints. Clicking on one of the categories in the dashlet graphs can create a filter that is applied to the table. The top of each column has a quick filter, allowing an administrator to narrow down the information that is displayed in both the table and the dashlets above the table. Clicking on one of the endpoint MAC addresses in the left column allows you to inspect data collected for the endpoint.

![[Pasted image 20230903180022.png]]

All information that is known about an endpoint is available when you click on its MAC address in the table. This information includes data that is learned from other sources besides the probe data, including authentication information, application information (if applications are checked by ISE), and any threat or vulnerability information learned from PXgrid.

Information learned from the profiling services will be listed under the Attributes tab, and includes any general attributes, custom attributes, and any other attributes that Cisco ISE has learned. If you need to create any custom profiler conditions and/or policies, you can search here for attributes that ISE has learned. If the attributes are listed here, then ISE will be able to apply them to any profiler policies that you create.
