Identifying the who, what, and how of endpoints connected to your network is one of the most important tasks involved in providing secure access to your network. It is also a major component for meeting compliance policies that may be in effect for your organization.

This training introduces the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Profiler service, which can greatly simplify the important task of identifying endpoints.

# ISE Profiler Benefits and Capabilities

The profiler service represents an extra block in the Cisco ISE information flow and is available as part of the Advantage and Premier licensing tiers with version 3.X. The primary goal of the profiler is to classify the endpoints connected to your network by using the most appropriate endpoint profile. The endpoint profile is a first step in identifying the endpoint identity group that the endpoint should belong to. The endpoint identity group is an attribute that you can use when defining conditions in the authentication and authorization policies.

Profiling is useful in situations where certain corporate assets must be differentiated from noncorporate assets. It may be used to help regulate network access and assign additional network authorization permissions. This usage is based on the policy group of the device.

Enterprises deploy the profiler service for two main reasons:

- **Create a learned inventory:** The profiler service provides a contextual inventory of all endpoints that are using network resources. It discovers connected endpoints and where they exist on the network.
    
- **Determine the applicable Endpoint Identity Group:** The profiler service matches endpoints to a profiler policy. These profiler policies can be used to determine which identity group the endpoint should be assigned to. The identity group specified by the device profile can then be used as a condition in the authorization policy. In this way, you can affect the endpoint network permissions.
    

# How the ISE Profiler Works

Because the profiling service can discover, locate, and identify the endpoint classification of endpoints connected to your network, it enables you to ensure that network access is granted based on the complete contextual identity of the endpoints.

The profiling service begins its work by collecting attributes or a set of attributes for each endpoint that ISE receives data for, regardless of its authentication status, or even if the device has attempted an authentication on the network at all. The profiling service collects the attributes from various sources called probes (such as RADIUS and other protocols) and uses them to help identify the “what” of the endpoint. These attributes can be viewed by an administrator in the Context Visibility section of the admin portal as attribute-value pairs, and profiler policies can use these values to identify the endpoint profile for the MAC address of the endpoint.

These attribute-value pairs are associated to endpoints based on the following:

- endpoint capability
    
- network access device (NAD) capability and configuration
    
- methods (probes) that are used to collect these attributes
    

After collecting the attributes for an endpoint, the profiler service classifies the endpoint.

During the classification process, the endpoint MAC address uniquely identifies each endpoint. The MAC address and other attribute values collected are compared against profiler policies to determine the endpoint profile. The endpoint profile can be used to match endpoints to an identity group or to an endpoint logical profile, either of which can be used to match a rule in an authorization policy.

Within each profiling policy, you can either match that policy to a specific identity group or define a parent profiling policy to associate with the policy.

> Note
> An identity group can be a pre-existing system group or a new group created by an administrator.

> Note
> You can define your own endpoint profiling policies, or you can use preconfigured default policies.

The Profiler service stores endpoints with their matched profiles in the Cisco ISE database. All attributes that the profiling service uses are defined in profiler dictionaries. Most of the needed attributes are provided by Cisco, but administrators can create their own dictionary entries if needed.

The profiler service identifies endpoints by MAC address. If an endpoint is evaluated based on its IP address and the binding between its IP address and MAC address cannot be established, the IP-related profiling state will be lost. RADIUS AAA can be used to map the MAC address to the IP address. If RADIUS is unable to provide the mapping, it can be obtained from DHCP or NMAP sources.

Although you are accessing the endpoint record from the Endpoint Classification tab, the record contains all information that ISE has collected about the endpoint from all sources. This includes applications that IDE has discovered running on the endpoint, the profiler attributes that ISE has learned, any authentications the endpoint has performed, any vulnerabilities seen on the endpoint, and any threats posed by the endpoint. Clicking on the Attributes tab will allow you to view the Profiler information that ISE has collected for the endpoint.

Within the endpoint record, you also have the option to statically assign the endpoint profile or identity group. If either the endpoint profile or identity group is statically assigned, ISE continues to collect endpoint attributes for the endpoint from the network, but will not override the static assignment, even if a better match is found.

# ISE Profiler Components

An ISE Policy Service Node with the profiler service enabled collects probes from the network. The probes contain endpoint attributes that can be mapped back to the endpoint MAC address and can be analyzed by ISE to determine the endpoint profile.

The Profiler service runs only on Cisco ISE nodes that provide the policy service. In a distributed deployment, the profiler service does not run on Cisco ISE nodes that only provide other services, such as administration and monitoring.

The profiler service is composed of the following components:

- **The Sensor:** The sensor collects data from several probes and obtains information on the endpoints. The sensor then forwards the attributes and their attribute values to the analyzer. The probe manager within the sensor supports the profiler service, initializing and controlling various probes that run on the sensor. The probe manager allows you to configure probes and to start and stop collecting the attributes and their values from the endpoints. An event manager within the sensor can communicate events between the probes and the probe manager. A forwarder stores endpoints in the Cisco ISE database along with their attribute data. Cisco ISE then notifies the analyzer of newly detected endpoints.
    
- **The Analyzer:** The analyzer evaluates endpoints by using the configured policies. It then classifies the endpoints with the matched endpoint profile in the Cisco ISE database.
