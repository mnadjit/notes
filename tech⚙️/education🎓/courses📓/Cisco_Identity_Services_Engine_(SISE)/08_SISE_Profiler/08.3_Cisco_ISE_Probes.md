The Profiler service of the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) collects data about endpoints connected to the network from many sources that are defined as probes. The information collected is used to match endpoints to their correct endpoint profiles.

This training describes the types of ISE probes, how they are enabled within Cisco ISE, and how they collect attributes from the network to identify endpoints.

# Probes on the PSN

The profiling service is part of the Policy Service persona in a Cisco ISE deployment. Profiling is enabled by default on Policy Service Nodes (PSNs) with Cisco Advantage or higher licensing in version 3.X. However, the service can be disabled to free up resources if profiling is not needed on a device.

![[Pasted image 20230903131834.png]]

As part of the profiling service, probes are enabled on PSNs in a Cisco ISE deployment. A probe is used to collect an attribute or a set of attributes from an endpoint on your network. To gain more network visibility, probes allow you to add endpoints to the endpoint database and update endpoints with their matched profile by analyzing device behavior.

When profiling is enabled on the PSN, a Profiling Configuration tab appears in the **Administration > System > Deployment** menu of the ISE Admin portal.

There are several probes enabled by default when the profiling service is started. The pre-enabled probes include DHCP, RADIUS, NMAP, SNMPQUERY, and Active Directory. These probes typically will provide enough attribute data for proper classification of endpoints, but there may be times when the profiler configuration needs to be altered to obtain better, or different, attributes than the default configuration provides.

To determine the probes that are required for your particular deployment, review the condition details of the profiles that you want to match. For each profile, you can capture unique attributes and the required probes that are based on the contained conditions. For example, you would not want to use probes that identify fixed network devices, such as SNMP query, for profiling endpoints that are tied to user access.

The ISE profiler adds or modifies endpoint MAC addresses in the endpoint database. If it does not find an entry in the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache, then it can add or update endpoints by using the Layer 2 MAC address of an HTTP packet or the IN_SRC_MAC of a NetFlow packet in Cisco ISE.

The profiling service depends on Layer 2 adjacency when endpoints are only a hop away. When endpoints are Layer 2-adjacent, the IP addresses and MAC addresses of endpoints are already mapped and there is no need for IP-MAC cache mapping. If endpoints are not Layer 2-adjacent and are multiple hops away, mapping may not be reliable.

# RADIUS Probe

The RADIUS probe evaluates RADIUS attributes received in authentication and accounting messages from network access devices (NADs). RADIUS accounting provides MAC-to-IP binding and supports other probes that rely on IP address such as DNS, NetFlow, NMAP, and HTTP probes.

![[Pasted image 20230903131851.png]]

Cisco ISE can act as a RADIUS server and a RADIUS proxy client to other RADIUS servers. When it acts as a proxy client, it uses external RADIUS servers to process RADIUS requests and response messages. Whether acting as the RADIUS server, or as a RADIUS proxy, the profiler collects RADIUS attributes as the RADIUS requests and responses are received. The profiler then uses these collected attributes to profile endpoints.

You can create a RADIUS-type profiling condition to extract the endpoint IP address from the RADIUS Framed-IP-Address attribute. If the NAD is appropriately configured, the Calling-Station-ID attribute contains the endpoint MAC address. The first 3 bytes of a MAC address is the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI). This identifier reveals the network interface card (NIC) vendor to Cisco ISE and to you.

The MAC address to IP address binding that RADIUS accounting messages provide allows for probe attributes gathered from IP specific probes, such as HTTP or Active Directory, to be mapped back to the corresponding endpoint.

RADIUS probe data such as NAS-Port and NASs port ID are utilized by the SNMP Query probe to trigger a query for information from the NAD about the connected device. It is a best practice to use the RADIUS probe, as it avoids the need to use SNMP traps to trigger SNMP queries—meaning that you get the same information with less overhead.

When you set up SNMP for NADs to work with ISE, the SNMP query probe periodically gains information from the NAD. When a new device authenticates to a switch port, RADIUS gathers the information so that it is available for the SNMP-query probe. The RADIUS probe sends this information at the time of the authentication and triggers the SNMP query probe to search for that specific interface.

# Switch Device Sensor

Available on Cisco IOS switch devices, the device sensor feature is used to gather raw endpoint data from network devices by using protocols such as Cisco Discovery Protocol, Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). The Cisco ISE analyzer acts as the external client of the device sensor and receives endpoint data via RADIUS accounting messages.

![[Pasted image 20230903131901.png]]

The device sensor sends client notifications and accounting messages containing profiling data along with the session events. The sensor also sends other session-related data such as MAC address and ingress port to Cisco ISE.

By default, for each supported peer protocol, client notifications and accounting events are generated only when incoming packets include a type, length, value (TLV) that has not been previously received in the context of a given session. However, you can enable client notifications and accounting events for all TLV changes, whether the TLV is new or has been previously received, by entering the command `device-sensor notify all-changes`.

By default, on all Cisco IOS switch devices, the device sensor is enabled with the following TLVs:

- **Cisco Discovery Protocol filter:** secondport-status-type and powernet-event-type (type 28 and 29). Of course, Cisco Discovery Protocol must be configured properly on the switch.
    
- **LLDP filter:** organizationally specific (type 127). LLDP must be configured properly on the switch.
    
- **DHCP filter:** message-type (type 53). DHCP snooping must be configured on the switch.
    

> Note

As of Cisco IOS Release 15.2(1)E, you can exclude protocols from being analyzed by the device sensor feature with the `device-sensor filter-spec` `protocol` `exclude all` command in global configuration mode.

# WLC Device Sensor

If you are currently using legacy Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs), such as the 2500/5500/8500 Series devices, or WLCs running the Aironet operating system, you can make use of device sensor capabilities. For these legacy devices, the device sensor forwards the DHCP and HTTP user agent string in the RADIUS accounting packets to Cisco ISE.

![[Pasted image 20230903131946.png]]

To enable the device sensor on the WLC, from the WLC admin page, navigate to WLANs, choose the target WLAN, and then click the Advanced tab. Scroll down to the section labeled Radius Client Profiling. Check both the DHCP Profiling and HTTP Profiling checkboxes. The WLC will then send profiling information to ISE via RADIUS accounting, a more efficient method to gather client information than using the DHCP probe.

Alternatively, if you use the DHCP probe, you must disable DHCP proxy on the controller. This setting causes the controller to bridge DHCP requests to the upstream router, which should be configured with helper addresses; one helper address is that of the actual DHCP server, and the other is the Cisco ISE PSN, for profiling.

Similar to the legacy wireless LAN controller, the Cisco IOS-XE WLC GUI has a single check box in the WLAN configuration to enable RADIUS profiling. This option is found in the **Access Policies** tab when editing the WLAN Policy Profile.

> Note
> The WLC device sensor does not gather as much detailed information as using the DHCP probe. For example, the device sensor does not provide the DHCP Options attribute, among others. However, Cisco recommends using the device sensor if it provides the information needed for adequate profiling.

# SNMP Trap Probe

As endpoints connect or disconnect from your network, the change of the NAD ports’ state is reported to ISE. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Trap probe receives information from specific NADs that support MAC notification, link up, link down, and informs to add endpoints to the ISE database.

![[Pasted image 20230903132001.png]]

For the SNMP Trap probe to be fully functional and add endpoints, you must:

- Configure the NAD to send SNMP traps
    
- Enable the SNMP Query probe which triggers a poll event for the NAD port when ISE receives a trap from it
    

The SNMP Trap probe is only valuable in rare, special use cases. It is preferable to use the RADIUS probe for the following reasons:

- The SNMP trap probe introduces more overhead than the RADIUS probe to obtain similar information.
    
- When configuring the SNMP trap probe, you must manually configure the PSN IP addresses, and the PSN you configure may not be the one involved in authentication.
    

> Note
> Cisco ISE does not support SNMP traps that it receives from legacy Wireless LAN Controllers such as the 2500/5500/8500 Series WLCs and legacy access points.

# SNMP Query Probe

The SNMP Query probe triggers a poll event to retrieve information about a particular NAD port.

![[Pasted image 20230903132020.png]]

There are two types of SNMP Query probes:

- **Periodic system query:** This probe triggers periodic polling at a configurable interval. It reads the following MIBs: System, cdpCacheEntry, lldpLocalSystemData, lldpRemoteSystemsData, cLApEntry (legacy WLC only), and cldcClientEntry (legacy WLC only). The polling is distributed between all PSNs with the SNMPQUERY probe enabled. The PSNs attempt to collect ARP information to build an IP ARP cache table.
    
- **Triggered interface query:** This probe is triggered by receiving a SNMP trap or RADIUS Accounting Start for a specific interface. The probe reads the following MIBs: interface data (ifIndex, ifDesc, and more), Cisco Discovery Protocol and LLDP data, session data, as well as port, VLAN, and 802.1X data.
    

To configure the SNMP Query probe, from the ISE admin portal, navigate to the Edit Node page. You also must configure SNMP settings for new NADs in the Network Devices List page. Here, you can specify a polling interval to query NADs at regular intervals.

You can enable and disable the following SNMP queries for specific NADs as follows:

- SNMP query on link up and new MAC notification
    
- SNMP query on link up and new MAC notification for Cisco Discovery Protocol information
    
- SNMP query timer for once an hour for each switch by default
    

> Note

For Apple iOS and other mobile devices that do not support SNMP, MAC address discovery occurs via the ARP table. NADs can query the ARP table with an SNMP Query probe.

**Cisco Discovery Protocol Support with SNMP Query**

When you configure SNMP settings on network devices, be sure that Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled on all ports. It is enabled by default. Disabling Cisco Discovery Protocol on any NAD ports may cause improper profiling without Cisco Discovery Protocol information for connected endpoints.

Enable Cisco Discovery Protocol globally on the NAD with the command `cdp run`. Enable Cisco Discovery Protocol on any NAD interface with the command `cdp enable`. Add the word `no` before these commands to disable Cisco Discovery Protocol.

**LLDP Support with SNMP Query**

The Cisco ISE profiler uses an SNMP query to collect LLDP attributes. You can also use the RADIUS probe to collect LLDP attributes from a NAD-embedded Cisco IOS sensor. Use appropriate Cisco syntax to configure your particular NADs to run LLDP globally and per interface.

# DHCP Probes

The Cisco ISE DHCP probe collects DHCP request attributes from a DHCP client, proxy, and Cisco IOS helper.

![[Pasted image 20230903132050.png]]

The probe evaluates DHCP requests of INIT-REBOOT and SELECTING message types. Although other DHCP message types, such as RENEWING and REBINDING, are also processed, they are not used for profiling endpoints. Attributes that are parsed from DHCP packets are mapped to endpoint attributes.

To configure the DHCP probe from the ISE admin, you specify which Cisco ISE interface to use for data capture.

There are two DHCP-related probe types:

- **DHCP Probe:** Used when the PSN interface is the destination for DHCP relay traffic. DHCP proxy is also supported, but NADs cannot typically send to more than one target at same time—only after failure or timeout of the primary.
    
- **DHCP SPAN Probe:** Captures DHCP packets from a mirrored port such as from Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN), Remote Switched Port Analyzer (RSPAN), and Encapsulated Remote Switched Port Analyzer (ERSPAN). A dedicated Cisco ISE interface is strongly recommended for this probe type. Be sure to enable the Cisco ISE interface from the CLI and make any necessary physical connections to the SPAN port.
    

> Note

The endpoint gateway device must be configured to send DHCP requests to the PSN in addition to the real DHCP server, proxy, or helper address. The gateway acts as the access device for the endpoint and should have a switched virtual interface (SVI) configured for the client VLAN.

# DNS Probe

The Domain Name System (DNS) probe performs a DNS lookup for the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of an endpoint.

![[Pasted image 20230903132101.png]]

The PSN performs a reverse DNS lookup (FQDN lookup) against specified name servers that you define in your Cisco ISE deployment. DNS lookups require the enablement of the DNS probe along with one of the following probes: DHCP, DHCP SPAN, HTTP, RADIUS, or SNMP.

The DNS probe retrieves endpoint FQDNs upon learning endpoint IP address from one of the following sources:

- **RADIUS probe:** framed-ip-address
    
- **HTTP probe:** SourceIP
    
- **SNMP probe:** cdpCacheAddress
    
- **DHCP probes:** dhcp-requested-address
    
- **Device sensor:** dhcp 61:client-identifier
    

A new FQDN attribute is added to the attribute list for an endpoint in the system IP dictionary. This attribute can be used for an endpoint profiling policy evaluation. You can create an endpoint profiling condition to validate the FQDN attribute and its value for profiling.

> Note

To resolve FQDNs for clients with dynamically assigned IP addresses, you must configure Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS).

# HTTP Probe

The HTTP probe collects the endpoint information in an HTTP request-header. The ISE profiler captures web browser information from the User-Agent attribute. It also captures other HTTP attributes from the request messages and adds them to the list of endpoint attributes.

![[Pasted image 20230903132110.png]]

Cisco ISE listens to web browser communication on port 80 and port 8080. You can use the Cisco ISE default, built-in profiles, or create your own, to identify endpoints that are based on the User-Agent attribute.

When the HTTP probe is enabled with the SPAN probe, the profiler can capture HTTP packets from specified interfaces. You can use the SPAN capability on port 80, where the Cisco ISE server listens to communication from the web browsers.

HTTP SPAN also collects IP addresses for Layer 3 IP headers. These addresses can be associated to an endpoint based on its MAC address that is contained in the Layer 2 header. This information is useful for identifying different mobile and portable IP-enabled devices such as Apple devices and computers with different operating systems. Identification reliability is improved because the Cisco ISE server redirects captures during a guest login or client provisioning download. This capability allows the profiler to collect the User-Agent attribute and other HTTP attributes from request messages and then identify devices by type—Apple, Android, and more.

If you deploy Cisco ISE on an ESXi server (VMware), the Cisco ISE profiler collects DHCP traffic but not HTTP traffic. This difference is due to configuration issues on the vSphere client. To collect HTTP traffic for VMware deployments, configure VMware security settings for the virtual switch that you create for the Cisco ISE profiler. Change the promiscuous mode from Reject to Accept. When the SPAN probe for DHCP and HTTP is enabled, Cisco ISE profiler then collects both the DHCP and HTTP traffic.

> Note

To configure promiscuous mode in VMware-based Cisco ISE deployments, from vSphere, navigate to **Configuration > Networking > Properties > VMNetwork > VMswitch0 > Properties > Security** and check the **Promiscuous Mode** check box in the **Policy Exceptions** pane.

# HTTP Profiling Without Probes

![[Pasted image 20230903132119.png]]g)

The ISE profiler service attempts to profile endpoints using HTTP, even when the HTTP probe is not enabled. The figure illustrates the PSN obtaining the endpoint MAC address via the connection’s SessionID. Cisco ISE can minimally profile the endpoint with attributes such as device type.

You can also easily use URL redirection in profiling, and it requires no device sensors. For a wireless use case, you can use an ACL to redirect traffic to the Cisco ISE PSN. This functionality allows determination of the endpoint type based on the User-Agent field, which is supplied in the HTTP redirect request.

# Profile Attributes Obtained Without Probes

Some profile attributes can be collected by the ISE profiling service without having to enable any probes. For example, in the following figure, the profiler has assigned the device to the Apple-iPad identity group, even though all probes are inactive.

![[Pasted image 20230903132126.png]]

This endpoint’s detailed page displays the EndpointSource as CP (client provisioning), which is the source of the latest received attributes. The MAC address has been retrieved from the RADIUS Calling-Station-ID attribute via SessionID lookup. No IP address is listed for the endpoint; the profiling occurred without a MAC-to-IP address binding.

# NetFlow Probe

The NetFlow probe collects endpoint attributes, such as source and destination endpoint MAC addresses, from NetFlow-enabled NADs to create a dictionary of NetFlow attributes that support NetFlow-based profiling.

![[Pasted image 20230903132133.png]]

Cisco IOS NetFlow Version 9 is a Cisco-specific feature that allows you to access network IP flows. IP flows can be exported from NetFlow-enabled NADs via UDP, a non-congestion-aware protocol.

The Cisco ISE profiler implements Cisco IOS NetFlow Version 9 and supports earlier versions beginning with Version 5. The MAC address is not a part of IP flows in earlier versions of NetFlow, therefore, you must profile endpoints by their IP address. If you are using a version of NetFlow prior to version 5, you will want to correlate attributes that are collected from NADs in the endpoint cache.

The NetFlow probe can classify devices based on unique patterns of communication with specific addresses or particular TCP or UDP ports. For example, a health monitor in a hospital setting may connect back to a centralized server on a particular set of TCP ports.

It is a best practice to use a dedicated interface on Cisco ISE to collect NetFlow data.

> Note

Use the NetFlow probe with caution because it can adversely affect system performance.

# NMAP Probe

The Cisco ISE Nmap probe can perform an active endpoint scan using Network Mapper (NMAP). NMAP is integrated with the Cisco ISE profiler to augment its profiling capability. This integration can provide for better endpoint classification, particularly for mobile devices. You can manually scan a specific subnet with the Nmap probe or associate a network scan action to an endpoint profile to scan an endpoint.

![[Pasted image 20230903132146.png]]

There are two types of network scans that can be performed:

- **Manual network scan:** The manual subnet scan is performed on-demand and it detects constantly connected devices that have static IP addresses. These devices can include printers, which may not be discoverable by other probes. Scanned devices are added to the endpoints list, but only if the IP-to-MAC address binding exists. The Nmap probe is not required to be enabled for manual network scans.
    
    Subnet scanning is a lengthy, resource-intensive procedure that is based on the size and density of the subnet. You can scan only a single subnet at a time, and the scan can be canceled at any time while in progress.
    
    Each subnet scan has a unique numeric ID. Endpoint source information is updated with this scan ID. Upon detection, the endpoint source information can also be updated to indicate that it is discovered by the Nmap probe.
    
    Depending on the location of the scanned subnet, the scan may or may not return endpoint MAC addresses. ARP resolution is entirely dependent on network topology. For remote networks, Cisco ISE must be able to resolve endpoint MAC addresses from the IP addresses received. If they are not resolved to MAC addresses, then there is no way to map those IP addresses to actual endpoints, and they are dropped.
    
- **Endpoint scan:** As compared to resource-intensive network scans, an endpoint scan limits Cisco ISE system resource usage by scanning a single endpoint at a time. This scan type, which is typically triggered by matching a profile policy, improves endpoint classification and redefines endpoint profiles.
    

The predefined scanning actions when an endpoint is scanned are the following:

- **OS-scan:** Scans endpoint operating system and version. This scan is resource-intensive.
    
- **SNMPPortsAndOS-scan:** Scans endpoint operating system and version. It also triggers an SNMP Query when SNMP ports (161 and 162) are open. This functionality can improve classification for endpoints that are identified and matched initially with an Unknown profile.
    
- **CommonPortsAndOS-scan:** Scans endpoint operating system and version. It also scans common TCP and UDP ports, but not SNMP ports.
    

![[Pasted image 20230903132205.png]]

Once an endpoint is appropriately profiled, the configured network scan action cannot be used against that endpoint. For example, scanning an Apple-Device allows you to classify the scanned endpoint to an Apple device. Once an OS-scan determines the operating system that an endpoint is running, it is matched to an appropriate profile for that operating system and will not be changed.

Scanned data is added to the endpoint database only if MAC address is already listed in the endpoint database. In addition to learning the MAC address from RADIUS authentication, ISE can learn of MAC addresses from the ARP table, and from other probes that can provide MAC-to-IP binding.

For the NMAP scan to succeed, the scanned port numbers must be allowed by the NAD in the reverse direction. In this way, the NAD will permit the replies from the open port numbers to return to the PSN.

# Active Directory Probe

Microsoft Active Directory tracks detailed operating system information such as version and service-pack levels for computers that have joined Active Directory. The Active Directory probe retrieves this information directly by using the Active Directory Runtime connector to provide a highly reliable source of client operating system information, improving fidelity for Windows endpoints.

![[Pasted image 20230903132216.png]]

A basic but important attribute available to the Active Directory probe is whether an endpoint exists in Active Directory. This information can be used to distinguish between corporate and noncorporate assets.

To enable the Active Directory probe, from the ISE Admin portal, navigate to **Administration > System > Deployment > Profiling Configuration**. When enabled, Cisco ISE fetches Active Directory attributes for new endpoints when it receives a hostname. The hostname is typically learned from DHCP or DNS probes. To limit the load that queries have on Active Directory, once attributes are retrieved, Cisco ISE does not query Active Directory again for the same endpoint until the rescan timer expires. The default expiration is 1 day.

To see the entire list of attributes that Cisco ISE can collect from Active Directory, navigate to **Policy > Policy Elements > Dictionaries**, select **System > Active Directory** in the dictionary column on the left, and click on the Dictionary Attributes tab. From that list, the following attributes are used by the profiler service:

- AD-Host-Exists
    
- Ad-Join-Point
    
- AD-Operating-System
    
- AD-OS-Version
    
- AD-Service-Pack
    

# pxGrid Probe

ISE can also profile and display the status of devices attached to a Cisco Industrial Network Device (IND) with the PxGrid probe.

![[Pasted image 20230903132227.png]]

The Cisco Industrial Network Director (CIND) is designed to help operations teams gain full visibility of network and automation devices in the context of the automation process and provides improved system availability and performance, leading to increased Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). PxGrid connects ISE and the CIND to communicate endpoint (IoT) data. Once connected, pxGrid on ISE consumes CIND events to collect information and queries CIND to update the endpoint’s type.

To determine the ISE profiler dictionary attributes for IoT devices, from the ISE Admin portal, navigate to **Policy > Policy Elements > Dictionaries**, and select **IOTASSET** from the list of System Dictionaries.
