After a RADIUS request has been authenticated by the authentication policy, it is then matched to an authorization policy. This training introduces Cisco ISE authorization policy rules and their components.

The basic concept of the authorization policy is similar to that of the authentication policy. The request is compared to authorization rules in a top-down order until a match is found. Each rule is defined with matching conditions, configured similarly as within the authentication rules. When a match is found, Cisco ISE will apply an authorization profile that defines the RADIUS authorization parameters that will be applied.

# Cisco ISE Authorization

As shown in the preceding figure, after successful authentication, authorization controls client access levels. After the initial authorization is applied, three separate components may be used to learn more information about the access request: the posture service, the profiler, and the guest services. This topic focuses on the authorization process.

The posture and profiler services can be used in addition to the authentication and authorization services, and, if deployed, they may invoke additional information exchange. The guest services can be used if the user was not known during the initial authentication to allow the user identity to be determined using web-based authentication. If any of these components match a change in the authorization policy that needs to be applied, Cisco ISE will issue a Change of Authorization (CoA) to the access switch and enable the change in the applied policy.

# Authorization Policy Overview

Similar to authentication, Cisco ISE uses a modular network authorization policy. A Cisco ISE authorization policy is based on a set of rules. If a particular user, group identity, and set of conditions are met, then an appropriate authorization profile is pushed from the Cisco ISE Policy Service Node (PSN) to the Network Access Devices (NAD) to enforce appropriate permissions.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Monolithic/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Introducing_Cisco_ISE_Authorization_Rules_002.png)

Authorization profiles consist of attributes that are chosen from a set of resources that are stored in a dictionary. When a request matches the compound condition of a specific authorization policy, an appropriate profile is applied. Because authorization policies can include compound conditions that map to a single network service rule, these policies can also include a list of authorization checks.

Authorization profiles that define the permissions that are granted to client sessions include these policy elements:

- **dACL:** Cisco ISE can push downloadable Access Control Lists (dACLs) to an access switch that is used for a particular user session. When entry-level employee connects to a switch port, they may have very limited access. But when a high-level executive connects to the same port, they receive elevated access. For ports configured in Multi-Auth mode, it is applied per user. The Access Control List (ACL) is downloaded one time per NAD and can be applied to multiple sessions.
    
- **Airespace ACL:** Cisco ISE can use named ACLs configured on a Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC). Various users can connect to the same service set identifier (SSID) and gain appropriate access levels.
    
- **Web Redirection:** Redirect can forward clients to a particular portal for further actions such as Posture Client Download. This process uses Central Web Authentication (CWA), Device Registration WebAuth (DRW), Mobile Device Management (MDM), Native Supplicant Provisioning (NSP), and Client Provisioning for Posture (CPP) services.
    
- **VLAN:** Wired switch ports and wireless SSIDs are configured with a default VLAN. When a client attaches to a switch port or wireless SSID, it is assigned to that VLAN. However, when certain users authenticate, Cisco ISE can override this default VLAN and assign certain users to a different VLAN, perhaps based on Active Directory group membership or some other criteria.
    
- **Voice Domain Permission:** This element has an endpoint placed into the voice domain. Applies to multidomain authorization mode.
    
- **Auto Smart Port:** Cisco Auto Smartport technology enables appropriate Quality of Service (QoS) parameters to be applied to the port according to a template.
    
- **Filter ID:** Filter ID is an ACL name that is referenced by Cisco ISE. NAD applies a local ACL with this name to the session.
    
- **Reauthentication:** This element requires reauthentication and specifies a reauthentication timer.
    
- **MACsec Policy:** Media Access Control Security (MACsec) is the IEEE 802.1AE standard for authenticating and encrypting packets between two adjacent devices.
    
- **NEAT:** Network Edge Authentication Topology (NEAT) authenticates a switch that is placed outside a wiring closet with a switch that is placed inside the wiring closet before traffic from the unsecured switch can be forwarded.
    
- **WebAuth (Local):** This element enables web authentication to be performed on the NAD.
    
- **Adaptive Security Appliance VPN:** This element enables the Adaptive Security Appliance VPN group policy to be applied to the endpoint VPN session.
    
- **SGT:** Scalable Group Access (SGA) allows user identity information to be captured and tagged with each data packet. Scalable Group Access Control Lists (SGACLs) can be implemented at the egress point for some network resource (such as a file server). SGA-based access control allows you to keep the existing logical design at the access layer. With flexible policies and services, you can meet different business requirements without having to redeploy the security controls. This solution tags every packet at the ingress network device and enables the egress network devices to enforce traffic control closest to the destination.
    

# Authorization Profile Policy Elements

When configuring an authorization policy, policy elements are chosen within the authorization profile in a section called Common Tasks. The common tasks are policy elements that are typically defined in a Cisco environment.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Monolithic/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Introducing_Cisco_ISE_Authorization_Rules_003.png)

The list of policy elements changes as Cisco ISE is updated over time, but several of the common tasks that you might use in your environment include the following:

- **DACL Name:** Click the check box for the dACL and choose existing downloadable ACL options that are available. Cisco ISE provides two default values in the drop-down list: **PERMIT_ALL_IPV4_TRAFFIC or DENY_ALL_IPV4_TRAFFIC**. The list will include all current dACLs in the local database.
    
- **VLAN:** Click the check box and enter an attribute value that identifies a VLAN ID that you want associated with the new authorization profile that you are creating. Both integer and string values are supported for the VLAN ID. The format for this entry would be **Tunnel-Private-Group-ID: VLANnumber**.
    
    > Note
    
    If you do not choose a VLAN ID, Cisco ISE uses a default value of **VLAN ID = 1**. For example, if you only entered **123** as your VLAN number, the **Attributes Details** pane reflects the following value: **Tunnel-Private-Group-ID = 1:123**.
    
- **Voice Domain Permission:** Click the check box to enable the Vendor-Specific Attribute (VSA) of **cisco-av-pair** to be associated with a value of **device-traffic-class=voice**. In a multidomain authorization mode, if the network switch receives this VSA, the endpoint is placed in a voice domain after authorization.
    
- **Web Redirection:** Click the check box to enable a redirection process. Click the redirect process type, Centralized Web Auth , Client Provisioning (Posture), Hot Spot, MDM Redirect, or Native Supplicant Provisioning. Enter the name of the Redirect ACL on the device that you want to associate with this authorization profile and click the desired portal. Check the Static IP/Host Name check box to specify an exact IP address or hostname to which you want the user to be redirected. If this check box is not checked, the user will be redirected to the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the policy service node that received this request.
    
- **Auto SmartPort:** Click the check box to enable Auto SmartPort functionality and enter a corresponding event name value in the text box. Enabling this functionality enables the VSA cisco-av-pair with a value for this option as **auto-smart-port=event_name**. Your choice is reflected in the Attributes Details pane.
    
- **ACL (Filter-ID):** Click the check box to enable a RADIUS filter attribute that sends the ACL name that you define in the text box. This name is automatically appended with **.in**. Your choice is reflected in the Attributes Details pane.
    
- **Reauthentication:** Click the check box and enter a value in seconds for maintaining connectivity during reauthentication. You can also choose attribute values from the Timer drop-down list. You choose to maintain connectivity during reauthentication by choosing to use either the default (a value of 0) or **RADIUS-Request** (a value of 1). Setting the value to the RADIUS-Request value maintains connectivity during the reauthentication process.
    
- **MACSec Policy:** Click the check box to enable the MACSec encryption policy whenever a MACSec-enabled client connects to Cisco ISE. Choose one of the following three options: must-secure, should-secure, or must-not-secure. For example, your choice is reflected in the Attributes Details pane as: **cisco-av-pair=linksec-policy=should-secure**.
    
- **NEAT:** Click the check box to enable NEAT, a feature that extends identity recognition between networks.
    
- **Web Authentication (Local WebAuth):** Click the check box to enable local web authentication for this authorization profile. This value lets the switch recognize authorization for web authentication by Cisco ISE sending a VSA along with a dACL. The VSA is **cisco-av-pair=priv-lvl=15**, and this attribute is reflected in the Attributes Details pane.
    
- **Airspace ACL name:** Click the check box and enter an ACL name in the text field. This value is used in a required Airespace VSA to authorize the addition of a locally defined ACL to a connection on the WLC. For example, if you entered **Engineering_WLC_ACL**, that value would be reflected in the Attributes Details pane as: **Airespace-ACL-Name = Engineering_WLC_ACL**.
    
- **Adaptive Security Appliance VPN:** Click the check box to enable an adaptive security appliance VPN group policy. From the Attribute list, choose a value to configure this setting.
    

In the common tasks section in the authorization profile, there is an Advanced Attribute Settings section and an Attribute Details section.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Monolithic/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Introducing_Cisco_ISE_Authorization_Rules_004.png)

The Advanced Attribute settings allow you to push additional dictionary attributes to the NAD. They allow you to configure any authorization response that RADIUS supports.

The Attribute Details section shows what RADIUS authorization parameters will be included in a RADIUS access-accept message returned to the NAD. The attribute details that will be passed to the NAD in the preceding figure are **Access Type = Access_Accept and DACL = PERMIT_ALL_IPV4_TRAFFIC**.

# Change of Authorization

Traditionally, RADIUS clients (NADs) make authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) requests to RADIUS servers (Cisco ISE). Initially, however, there was no mechanism for RADIUS servers to dynamically update client authorization levels. To address this, RADIUS Change of Authorization (CoA) was defined in RFC 5176 and is supported by Cisco ISE.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Monolithic/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Introducing_Cisco_ISE_Authorization_Rules_005.png)

The preceding figure depicts one potential CoA flow. In this example, AuthC is short for authentication, and AuthZ is short for authorization. An explanation of the flow is as follows:

1. Initially, a switch port is in an unauthenticated state. The switch port ACL allows only basic network functionality. This functionality might include DHCP-based IP address assignment, TFTP download of IP phone configurations, Active Directory machine authentication, and 802.1X authentication.
    
2. An endpoint connects, and 802.1X-based user authentication completes successfully. The Cisco ISE authentication server sends a RADIUS Access-Accept message to the NAD. The NAD forwards an EAP Success message to the endpoint.
    
3. Although Cisco ISE is aware of the user identity, it has not yet performed a posture assessment. As such, it selects a temporary policy for this session.
    
4. Cisco ISE sends a RADIUS Access-Accept message to the switch, specifying an authorization policy that allows two things. (1) IP connectivity to Cisco ISE to allow the posture assessment to complete. (2) IP connectivity to a remediation server in case posture assessment fails. This policy is dynamically applied to the switch using a dACL.
    
5. The posture assessment completes, and the endpoint is found to be compliant. Cisco ISE associates a full access policy with the session.
    
6. Cisco ISE issues a CoA message to the switch, which causes a CoA process as follows: Cisco ISE issues a CoA message to the switch, which causes an update to the switch port authorization policy, granting full network access. The NAD replies by sending a RADIUS access request. Cisco ISE processes the request, matching it to a more specific authorization rule based on the new information about the user/endpoint. The new Authorization profile is applied, and the user/endpoint now has new access permissions.

The example presented is simplified for instructional purposes and does not necessarily include all real-world considerations or demonstrate real configuration syntax.

# Authorization Policy Configuration Overview

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Monolithic/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Introducing_Cisco_ISE_Authorization_Rules_006.png)

The primary steps to configure a Cisco ISE authorization policy are shown in the following example:

1. Create a rule name such as “AD Employee Access.”
    
2. Define conditions for the rule. The condition is that the user must be a member of the Employees AD group.
    
3. Apply a profile named “Employee Access”. If needed, you can also assign a Security Group as a result of the matched condition.
    
4. Apply a policy element to the profile named “Employee Access” to assign a downloadable ACL named “Employee_Access”.
    
5. Configure an ACL that denies access to subnet 10.1.30.0 and permits everything else. (The 10.1.30.0/24 subnet is a quarantine subnet, and employees should not have access to it.)
    

# Exception Policies in Policy Sets

Authorization rules are a component in a Policy Set configuration. The RADIUS request is first matched to a Policy Set, then to an authentication policy, and finally, it will be matched to an authorization policy. The standard authorization policies consist of rules that determine permissions for all users or for larger groups of typical user groups, such as employees or contractors. These groups share a common set of privileges.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Monolithic/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Introducing_Cisco_ISE_Authorization_Rules_007.png)

Exception policy rules are constructed like standard rules. They are used as exceptions to your standard authorization policy. Exception policies are used to meet an immediate or short-term need, such as authorizing a limited number of users, devices, or groups to access network resources. An exception policy allows you to create a specific set of customized values for an identity group, condition, or permission that is tailored for one user or a subset of users.

Exception rules are often used with Cisco ISE Endpoint Protection Services (EPS), which can be used to dynamically quarantine a set of hosts. Using the exception policy facilitates the use of EPS without modifying the overall authorization policy already in place.

As shown in the preceding figure, the order in which ISE processes policy is as follows:

1. Evaluate the policy set. Look at the policy conditions, top-down, until a condition is matched.
    
2. Evaluate the allowed protocols for the session. If the user is not using one of the allowed protocols, then authentication fails, and their access is rejected.
    
3. Evaluate the authentication rules and click the appropriate ID store. Assuming credentials are valid, continue to match authorization rules.
    
4. If local authorization policy exceptions have been defined, evaluate them to determine user access levels. If local exceptions are not defined, then take the next step.
    
5. Evaluate global authorization exceptions, if defined. If not defined, take the next step.
    
6. Evaluate the regular authorization policy rules to determine user access levels.
    

# Exception Policy Configuration Overview

Each Policy Set contains several policies within it. When you configure a local exception policy in a Policy Set, it is, as the name implies, local—it affects only that Policy Set.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Monolithic/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Introducing_Cisco_ISE_Authorization_Rules_008.png)

However, only one global exception policy appears in all Policy Sets. Regardless of which Policy Set you are editing (including the default Policy Set) when you configure the global exception policy, you are configuring the global exception policy that is applied to all Policy Sets.

Remember that policies are processed in top-down order. Global exceptions override your standard authorization policy, and the local exceptions override the global exception policy.

# Authentication Sessions

Cisco ISE uses sessions IDs for the identification and tracking of user sessions. Cisco ISE sessions are created when the NAD sends a RADIUS authentication request to the RADIUS server. In a Cisco ISE deployment, the Policy Service nodes act as RADIUS servers.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Monolithic/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Introducing_Cisco_ISE_Authorization_Rules_009.png)

The session ID consists of the Network Access Device (NAD) IP address, the session count, and the time stamp. The session ID is used for event correlation and applying the CoA to a specific session.

RADIUS authentications can be monitored in real-time from the Cisco ISE admin GUI. In addition, the Cisco ISE dashboard provides a summary of all authentications that take place in your network in the **Operations > RADIUS > Live Logs**.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Monolithic/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Introducing_Cisco_ISE_Authorization_Rules_010.png)

You can hover your mouse over the status icon to view the results of the authentication and a brief summary. To filter your results, enter your search criteria in any one or more of the quick filters (text boxes) that appear at the top of the list.

There is also a filter icon near the top-right corner. The filter feature enables you to easily control the order of columns and which columns are shown. This feature was used to create the example that is shown to organize authentication-related parameters to adjacent identities and to hide columns not relevant to this discussion. As you troubleshoot and verify RADIUS operations, you will find opportunities to use this feature.

You can display the endpoint session ID and much more detailed information by clicking the details icon (magnifying glass).

Although not shown, Cisco ISE also provides at-a-glance information about successful authentications and authentication failures in the form of dashlets that appear on the Cisco ISE dashboard. The dashboard displays as the first page when you log in to Cisco ISE.

# Authorization Verification

Cisco ISE provides a summary of all authentications that take place in your network and can be viewed from **Operations > RADIUS > Live Logs**.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Monolithic/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Introducing_Cisco_ISE_Authorization_Rules_011.png)

The Live Log output is customized by using the gear icon to show information relevant to authorization. You can identify user identity, the authorization policy that was applied to the user, and whether the policy conditions were matched.

A match condition for a particular authorization policy leads to the assignment of an authorization profile. This condition controls the endpoint level of access. If the user was matched to an unexpected policy, you might need to modify the policy rule conditions or change the order of the rules.

To view more authentication and authorization information about a particular user session, click the details icon.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Monolithic/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Introducing_Cisco_ISE_Authorization_Rules_012.png)

The Overview section of the user session details is similar to what you have seen from the main Live Logs display: the authentication policy, authorization policy, and authorization result.

For more information, scroll down to analyze the Authentication Details section, the Other Attributes section, and at the very bottom, the Result section.

# Authentication and Authorization Verification on the NAD

In addition to viewing the authentication and authorization results from Cisco ISE, you can also view them from the NADs’ CLI.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Monolithic/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Introducing_Cisco_ISE_Authorization_Rules_013.png)

The preceding figure displays the output from the `show authentication session interface <interface> details` command in Cisco IOS version 15.X. This output includes the username of the authenticated user (or MAC address for MAB) and the authorization results. The status of the session reports as “Authorized”, and the Server Policies shows an ACL is applied to the endpoint. The NAD is unaware of the authorization profile name that has been used on Cisco ISE to apply this ACL to the endpoint. The command output also displays the common session ID that was used for tracking a specific user session.

Summary information about authentications and the session ID can be viewed using the `show authentication session interface <interface>` command without the `details` parameter at the end of the command.

> Note

If you have transitioned to the new-style authentication configuration on your IOS device, you will use the command `show access-session interface <interface> details`.

To verify the access list that has been applied to the NAD access port after the authorization policy has been processed, use the show ip access-list interface <interface> command.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Monolithic/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Introducing_Cisco_ISE_Authorization_Rules_014.png)

The specific endpoint IP address replaces the source IP address in the dACL, in this case, 10.1.100.100. If your switch is configured with authentication host-mode multi-auth, there may be more than one IP address active on that port. If more than one IP address is active on the port, the access list will have lines that apply to each IP address as an individual host and will stack the individual access lists into one access list that is applied to the interface.

An explanation of the output shown in the preceding figure is as follows:

1. The host on interface GigabitEthernet 1/0/3 (10.10.30.11) has two access control entries applied.
    
2. The switch has performed authentication on two MAC addresses.
    
3. The MAC address on Gi1/0/3 (0050.568e.5602) was authenticated using dot1x.
    
4. The MAC address on GI1/0/1 (d478.9b49.52b0) was authenticated using MAB.
    
5. The status of both authentications is “Authorized”.
    

# Session ID Usage in Authorization Verification

In a cisco environment, RADIUS messages will include the session ID in accounting messages as well as any CoA messages. This ensures that all messages are matched to the correct session and can be used to find authentication actions when troubleshooting on either the switch or in the admin GUI of Cisco ISE.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Monolithic/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Introducing_Cisco_ISE_Authorization_Rules_015.png)

The session ID helps you to determine that the user session that you are diagnosing on the NAD is the same session you are diagnosing on Cisco ISE. For example, notice in the preceding figure that the session ID in the details report on Cisco ISE is the same as the session ID shown in the output of the `show authentication session interface <interface>` command on the switch.
