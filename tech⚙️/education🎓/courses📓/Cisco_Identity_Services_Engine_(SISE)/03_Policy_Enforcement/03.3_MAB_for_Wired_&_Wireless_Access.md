Some endpoints that connect to the network do not support 802.1X authentication. This training describes MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB), an authentication protocol that can be used when 802.1X is not an option.

# What Is MAC Authentication Bypass?

Static MAC authentication, also known as MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB), uses a MAC address for both the username and password.

MAB is the most basic form of authentication in deployments. Since MAC addresses are easily spoofed, they are a relatively weak form of authentication, but they are a good first step for device identification.

## MAB Benefits and Limitations

|Benefits|Limitations|
|---|---|
|Visibility|Pre-existing MAC Database|
|Identity-Based Services|Delay (if MAB is fallback for 802.1X)|
|Access Control at the Edge|No User Authentication|
|Fallback or Standalone Authentication|Strength of Authentication|
|Device Authentication||

MAB offers the following benefits on wired networks:

- **Visibility:** MAB provides network visibility because the authentication process provides a way to link the IP address, MAC address, switch, and port of a device. This visibility is useful for security audits, network forensics, network use statistics, and troubleshooting.
    
- **Identity-based services:** MAB enables you to dynamically deliver customized services that are based on the endpoint MAC address. For example, a device might be dynamically authorized for a specific VLAN or assigned a unique access list that grants appropriate endpoint access. All the dynamic authorization techniques that work with IEEE 802.1X authentication will also work with MAB (ACL, VLAN, SGT).
    
- **Access control at the edge:** MAB acts at Layer 2, allowing you to control network access at the access edge.
    
- **Fallback or standalone authentication:** In a network that includes both 802.1X-capable and -incapable devices, MAB can be deployed as a fallback or complementary mechanism to IEEE 802.1X. If the network has no IEEE 802.1X-capable devices, MAB can be deployed as a standalone authentication mechanism.
    
- **Device authentication:** MAB can be used to authenticate devices that are not capable of IEEE 802.1X or that do not have a user (example: printers).
    

MAB enables visibility and security, but it also has limitations that your design must consider, such as the following:

- **MAC database:** As a prerequisite for MAB, you must have a preexisting database of MAC addresses of the devices that are allowed on the network. Creating and maintaining an up-to-date MAC address database is one of the primary challenges of deploying MAB.
    
- **Delay:** When it is used as a fallback mechanism to IEEE 802.1X, MAB waits for IEEE 802.1X to time out before validating the MAC address. During the timeout period, no network access is provided by default. Delays in network access can negatively affect device functions and the user experience. A mitigation technique is required to reduce the impact of this delay.
    
- **No user authentication:** MAB can only be used to authenticate devices, not users. Different users who are logged in to the same device will have the same network access.
    
- **Strength of authentication:** Unlike IEEE 802.1X, MAB is not a strong authentication method. MAB can be defeated by spoofing the MAC address of a valid device.
    
# MAB Behavior

MAB enables port-based access control using the MAC address of the endpoint. The figure illustrates the default behavior of a MAB-enabled port.

![[Pasted image 20230826173535.png]]

Before MAB, the identity of the endpoint is unknown and all traffic is blocked. The switch examines a single frame to learn and authenticate the source MAC address. After MAB succeeds and the identity of the endpoint is known, it allows all traffic from that endpoint. The switch performs source MAC address filtering to help ensure that only the MAB-authenticated endpoint is allowed to send traffic.

# MAB Functional Operation: Message Flow

![[Pasted image 20230826173551.png]]

The figure illustrates the high-level functional sequence of MAB. In this example, MAB is configured as a fallback mechanism to 802.1X. If 802.1X is not enabled, or is configured to run after MAB, the sequence is the same, except that MAB starts immediately after link-up, instead of waiting for IEEE 802.1X to time out.

- **Phase 1 - Initiation:** From the switch’s perspective, authentication begins when the switch detects link-up on a port. The switch initiates authentication by sending an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) Request-Identity message to the endpoint. If the switch does not receive a response, it retransmits the request at periodic intervals. If no response is received after the maximum number of retries, the switch lets IEEE 802.1X time out and proceeds to MAB.
    
- **Phase 2 - MAC Address Learning:** During the MAC address learning stage, the switch begins MAB by opening the port to accept a single packet. The switch will then learn the source MAC address of the endpoint. Packets that are sent before the port has fallen back to MAB (that is, during the IEEE 802.1X timeout phase) are discarded immediately. They cannot be used to learn the MAC address.
    
    The switch can use almost any Layer 2 and Layer 3 packets to learn MAC addresses. The exception is bridging frames, such as Cisco Discovery Protocol, Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), Spanning Tree Protocol (SPT), and Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP).
    
    After the switch learns the source MAC address, it discards the packet. Then the switch crafts a RADIUS Access-Request packet.
    
    By default, the Access-Request message is a Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) authentication request. The request includes the source MAC address in three attributes: Attribute 1 (Username), Attribute 2 (Password), and Attribute 31 (Calling-Station-Id).
    
    Although the MAC address is the same in each attribute, the format differs, which is important because different RADIUS servers may use different attributes for MAC address validation. Some RADIUS servers may look at only Attribute 31 (Calling-Station-Id), while others will verify the username and password in Attributes 1 and 2.
    
    MAB uses the MAC address as both a username and password, so be sure that the RADIUS server can differentiate MAB requests from other request types. This differentiation will prevent other clients from attempting to use a MAC address as a valid credential. Cisco switches uniquely identify MAB requests by setting Attribute 6 (Service-Type) to 10 (Call-Check) in a MAB Access-Request message. Therefore, you can use Attribute 6 to filter MAB requests at the RADIUS server.
    
    Optionally, you can configure Cisco switches to perform MAB as Extensible Authentication Protocol-Message Digest 5 (EAP-MD5) authentication, in which case the Service-Type attribute will be set to 1 (Framed). However, because the MAC address is sent in the clear in Attribute 31 (Calling-Station-Id), MAB EAP does not offer any additional security by encrypting the MAC address in the password. Also be aware that because the service type for MAB EAP is the same as an IEEE 802.1X request, the RADIUS server will not be able to easily differentiate MAB EAP requests from IEEE 802.1X requests.
    
- **Phase 3 - Authorization:** If the MAC address is valid, the RADIUS server returns a RADIUS Access-Accept message. This message informs the switch to allow endpoint port access. Optionally, the RADIUS server may include dynamic network access policy instructions in the Access-Accept message, which could be a dynamic VLAN or dACL. In the absence of dynamic policy instructions, the switch simply opens the port. If MAB succeeds, it will try no further authentication methods.
    
    If the MAC address is invalid or is rejected by network policy, the RADIUS server returns a RADIUS Access-Reject message. This message indicates that the switch should deny endpoint access to the port. Depending on how the switch is configured, several different outcomes are possible. If alternative authentication or authorization methods are configured, the switch may attempt IEEE 802.1X authentication or web authentication or deploy the guest VLAN.
    
    If no fallback authentication or authorization methods are configured, the switch will stop the authentication process and the port will remain unauthorized. You can configure the switch to restart authentication after a failed MAB attempt. You must configure the interface with the **authentication timer restart** feature. Once enabled, unknown MAC addresses will periodically fail authentication until the endpoint disconnects from the switch or the address gets added to a MAC database. To prevent the unnecessary control-plane traffic that is associated with restarting failed MAB sessions, Cisco generally recommends that you leave **authentication timer restart** disabled.
    
- **Phase 4 - Accounting:** If the switch can successfully apply the authorization policy, the switch can send a RADIUS Accounting-Request message to the RADIUS server with details about the authorized session.
    
# MAB Design Considerations

Several items should be considered in the network design before deploying MAB. These items include determining which devices you want to allow on the network, how to collect the MAC addresses of those devices, how to store the collected MAC addresses, and the processing order to be configured on the interface.

![[Pasted image 20230826173611.png]]

**MAC Address Discovery**

There are several ways to collect MAC addresses to populate your MAC address database. The easiest and most economical method is to find pre-existing inventories of MAC addresses. For example, in some companies, the purchasing department keeps rigorous records of the MAC addresses of every purchased device. Another good source for MAC addresses is any existing application that uses a MAC address in some way. For example, Cisco Unified Communication Manager keeps a list of the MAC addresses of every registered IP phone on the network.

**MAB Databases and RADIUS Servers**

After you have discovered and classified the allowed MAC addresses, you must store them in a database. The RADIUS server must access this database during the MAB attempt. You choose a MAC address storage location based on factors such as the capabilities of your RADIUS server. There are also deployment considerations for internal databases, external Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) databases, and Microsoft Active Directory, as described:

- **Internal Databases:** An obvious place to store MAC addresses is on the RADIUS server itself. With some RADIUS servers, you simply enter the MAC addresses in the local user database, setting both the username and password to the MAC address.
    
- **LDAP Databases:** A common choice for an external MAC database is an LDAP server. LDAP is a widely used protocol for information storage and retrieval. After you have collected MAC addresses, you can import them to the LDAP server and then configure your RADIUS server to query that server.
    
- **Microsoft Active Directory:** Microsoft Active Directory is a widely deployed directory service that is used to store user and domain computer identities. If centralizing all identities in a single store is important to you, you can use Active Directory as a MAC database. Sometimes, you may not have a choice. For Microsoft Network Policy Server (NPS) and Internet Authentication Service (IAS), Active Directory is the only choice for MAC address storage.
    
    Starting with Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Release 2 (R2) and Windows Server 2008, Microsoft Active Directory provides a special object class for MAC addresses that is called ieee802Device. Use this object class to simplify MAC address storage in Active Directory and avoid password complexity requirements.
    

**Interface Configuration**

Processing Order: Processing MAB before 802.1X allows for devices that cannot perform 802.1X to obtain network access before the 802.1X process times out. If these devices require DHCP services, they will be able to obtain an IP address before the DHCP process times out.

# Cisco ISE 802.1X and MAB Configuration

When configuring Cisco ISE for both for 802.1X and MAB, the authenticators, switch, and wireless LAN controller (WLC) need to be defined as network access devices (NADs) to allow for RADIUS communication from the NADs to Cisco ISE for authentication and authorization services.

![[Pasted image 20230826173632.png]]

Cisco ISE also needs to be configured to allow MAB authentications from the NADs. There is an allowed authentications configuration that is attached to the Policy Set in the Cisco ISE configuration. This list defines which 802.1X authentication methods are allowed and whether to allow MAB or not.

802.1X and MAB authentication policies must be defined. These policies determine which database or server will be accessed to verify the identity provided for authentication from the NADs.

Lastly, Authorization Policies defining the levels of access for users and endpoints that are authenticated must be configured.

# NAD 802.1X and MAB Configuration
There are some basic configurations that need to be performed on your NADs for RADIUS authentication of both 802.1X and MAB.

![[Pasted image 20230826173653.png]]

For access switches, AAA needs to be enabled globally and configured on individual ports. RADIUS servers need to be defined, as well as global AAA settings using RADIUS for network access authentication, authorization, and accounting.

For WLCs, you must define Cisco ISE as the RADIUS authentication servers and RADIUS accounting servers. When creating the WLAN, you must define the type of authentication or MAC filtering and assign the authentication and accounting servers. This is in addition to ensuring that all the WLC interfaces and ports are configured for network integration.

For advanced Cisco ISE features (guest access, profiling, BYOD, and posture), you should ensure that Change of Authorization (CoA) is supported by the NAD.
