# IEEE 802.1X Overview

![[Pasted image 20230826172501.png]]

IEEE 802.1X provides port-based authentication. There are three network devices in the 802.1X process with the following roles:

- **Supplicant:** Provides the endpoint 802.1X-compliant software service. It communicates with NAD authenticators to request network access. This service may be embedded as part of the endpoint operating system or installed as an application, such as Cisco AnyConnect Network Access Manager (Cisco NAM).
    
- **Authenticator:** Controls access to the network based on client authentication status. The objective here is for endpoints to authenticate to the authentication server via some Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). NAD authenticators act as an intermediary (proxy) between client and authentication server. They communicate with endpoint supplicants via 802.1X to request identity information. They then communicate with the authentication server via RADIUS to verify that information. They relay authentication server responses back to the client. The authenticator acts as a RADIUS client, encapsulating and de-encapsulating EAP frames.
    
- **Authentication Server:** Performs client authentication. The authentication server validates client identity and notifies NAD authenticators of the client authorization status. Because the authenticator acts as the proxy, the authentication service is transparent to the client. Cisco ISE acts as the authentication server.
    

When the switch receives Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN (EAPOL), it frames and relays them to the authentication server. The frame’s Ethernet header is stripped and then re-encapsulated into RADIUS format. The EAP fields are not modified during encapsulation, and the authentication server must support EAP within the native frame format.

When the authenticator receives EAP frames from the authentication server, the frame header is removed. The EAP frame is then encapsulated using EAPOL and sent to the supplicant.

# 802.1X Message Flow

Authentication can be initiated by the supplicant or the authenticator. The authenticator initiates authentication when the link state changes from down to up or periodically while the port remains up and unauthenticated.

![[Pasted image 20230826172953.png]]

The authenticator sends an EAP request or identity frame to request client identity. The supplicant receives the frame and sends an EAP response or identity frame. However, if during boot-up the supplicant does not receive an EAP request or identity frame, it can initiate authentication. The supplicant sends an EAPOL start frame, which prompts the authenticator to request client identity. The specific exchange of EAP frames varies based on the authentication method.

> Note
> If 802.1X is not enabled or supported on the NAD, EAPOL frames from the supplicant are dropped. If the supplicant does not receive an EAP request or identity frame after three attempts, the supplicant sends frames as if the port was in the authorized state. A port in the authorized state effectively means that the supplicant has been successfully authenticated.

When the supplicant provides its identity, the authenticator begins its role as the intermediary. The authenticator passes EAP frames between the supplicant and the authentication server until authentication succeeds or fails. If authentication succeeds, the authenticator port is authorized.

# 802.1X Authorization

The 802.1X framework provides both authentication and authorization of clients that seek network access. As a result of successful authentication, Cisco ISE can perform per-user and per-group network authorization.

![[Pasted image 20230826173009.png]]

The authorization features include the following:

- **VLAN assignment:** Enables the authentication server to associate a VLAN with a particular user or group, and therefore, the switch can dynamically assign a VLAN for that authenticated user. This VLAN assignment is appropriate if your desired access control method is based on different VLANs with access control lists (ACLs) or a firewall system.
    
- **ACL assignment:** The authentication server associates an ACL with a particular user or group. It then instructs the NAD to dynamically assign the ACL to the user session. This mechanism provides very granular access control, right down to the port level.
    
- **Time-based access:** The authentication server controls each user’s allowed-access days and times.
    
- **Scalable Group Access (SGA):** Formerly known as Security Group Access, SGA provides topology-independent scalable access control. With scalable group access, the ingress switches classify data traffic for a particular role and tag the traffic with scalable group tags (SGTs). The egress network devices evaluate the security group tags and filter packets by applying appropriate security group ACLs.
    

# 802.1X VLAN Assignment

Endpoints can be placed in VLANS through dynamic or default VLAN assignment.

![[Pasted image 20230826173023.png]]

- **Dynamic VLAN assignment:** After successful 802.1X/EAP authentication, the user can be authorized to be on a specific VLAN. This dynamic VLAN is configured on the Cisco ISE RADIUS service and communicated in a RADIUS Access-Accept message. While typically used to assign a VLAN upon successful authentication, it can also be used when authentication fails.
    
    1. For example, the authentication server can assign the guest VLAN when user authentication and MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) fail. The advantage to this method is that the guest VLAN assignment and access is centrally logged in the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) system. If no VLAN is assigned by the authentication server, it sends an Access-Reject message back to the switch and the switch uses its locally configured Guest VLAN or Restricted VLAN. In this case, there will not be a centralized audit trail to record this access in the AAA system.
        
- **Default VLAN assignment:** The default VLAN is the one that is configured on a wired switch port or for a wireless Service Set Identifier (SSID). When a client successfully authenticates, and no dynamic VLAN is assigned by the authentication server, this default VLAN is used.
    

# 802.1X Named ACLs

Named ACLs provide differentiated access for wireless users. After the user successfully authenticates, an authorization policy can inform a WLC which of its named ACLs it should apply for a wireless user session.

![[Pasted image 20230826173037.png]]

Named ACLs are configured locally on the Wireless Lan Controller (WLC). You merely reference the ACL in a Cisco ISE authorization policy. Of course, it is vital that the name you specify in Cisco ISE matches the actual name of the ACL defined in the WLC. These names are case-sensitive.

> Note
> As of IOS-XE version 17.10.1 dACL support is supported (pushed from ISE). Prior to version 17.8 ACL's are required to be configured on the WLC and the Authorization Profile must reference that named ACL.

# 802.1X Downloadable ACLs

Downloadable ACLs (dACL) can provide different levels of access to 802.1X-authenticated users. The RADIUS server authenticates 802.1X-connected users. Based on user identity, the RADIUS server retrieves ACL attributes and sends them to the switch. The switch applies attributes to the 802.1X port during the user session.

![[Pasted image 20230826173050.png]]

dACL use in wired networks is similar to named ACLs providing differentiated access for wireless users. dACLs are configured on Cisco ISE and are pushed down (downloaded) to the switch during the authentication/authorization process. However, Named ACLs are configured locally on the WLC. You merely reference this ACL in a Cisco ISE authorization policy.

The switch removes the per-user ACL configuration when the session ends, if authentication fails, or if a link-down condition occurs. The switch does not save RADIUS-specified ACLs in the running-configuration. When the port is unauthorized, the switch removes the ACL from the port. While the dACL is not part of the running configuration, it is in the device’s RAM. To verify the existence of the dACL use the `show access-list` [`name`] command.

RADIUS supports per-user attributes, including vendor-specific attributes. These vendor-specific attributes (VSAs) are in octet-string format. They are passed to the switch line-by-line as a result of the authorization process. The VSAs that are used for per-user ACLs use the syntax `inacl#<n>`.

An example of a dACL is:

`ip:inacl#100=permit ip any 209.165.201.2 255.255.255.255`
`ip:inacl#200=permit ip any 209.165.201.3 255.255.255.255`
`ip:inacl#300=deny ip any any`

 
# 802.1X Phased Deployment Modes

On a wired network, you can use a phased approach to deploying 802.1X. In a phased approach, you gradually introduce authentication and authorization with minimal network impact. The figure summarizes pre- and post-authentication behavior for the three 802.1X deployment phases: monitor, low-impact, and closed modes.

![[Pasted image 20230826173136.png]]
## Monitor Mode

In monitor mode, the open access feature allows end user access, regardless of authentication results. Thus, the 802.1X, MAB, or web authentication deployment has no effect on user access.

![[Pasted image 20230826173147.png]]

802.1X-enabled ports do not block traffic before successful authentication and authorization, as they would normally. This feature allows you to create an initial Cisco ISE deployment and learn about your network without having to worry about blocking access unintentionally.

Monitor mode is like placing a security camera at the door to monitor and record port access behavior. You can enable AAA RADIUS accounting to log authentication attempts and gain visibility on who and what is connecting to your network with an audit trail.

You can discover which endpoints connect to your network (PCs, printers, cameras, and so on), where these endpoints connect to the network (switch, port), whether they are 802.1X-capable or not, and whether they have valid credentials.

In the event of failed MAB attempts you can determine whether the endpoints have known, valid MAC addresses.

Monitor mode is enabled through 802.1X with the open access and multi-auth mode features of Cisco IOS. Monitor mode is configured with the `authentication open` and `authentication host-mode multi-auth` interface commands.

## Low-impact Mode

Low-impact mode allows you to incrementally increase security. You may have previously configured ports for open mode to gain insight into network and endpoint usage. Now you can configure these open ports with a pre-authentication ACL and permit only basic connectivity for unauthenticated hosts.

![[Pasted image 20230826173202.png]]

For example, unauthenticated users may be able to use DHCP, Domain Name System (DNS), and perhaps get to the Internet, without gaining access to all internal resources.

After successful authentication, the Cisco ISE authentication server sends a dACL to override any existing port ACL. This action provides differentiated access for authenticated users.

## Closed Mode

Another option for 802.1X-enabled switch ports is strict use of traditional closed mode along with differentiated access, which could be dynamic VLAN assignment, dACLs, or another authorization mechanism.

![[Pasted image 20230826173215.png]]

Formerly known as high-security mode, closed mode allows only EAPOL traffic until the authentication process completes, which is the default behavior of an 802.1X- enabled switch port.

## 802.1X Host Modes

The host mode of the 802.1X port determines whether more than one client can be authenticated on the port and how authentication will be enforced. You can configure an 802.1X port to use any of four host modes. Each mode can be modified to allow pre-authentication open access.

![[Pasted image 20230826173228.png]]

The four 802.1X host modes are as follows:

- **Single Host Mode:** In single-host mode, only one client can be connected to the 802.1X-enabled port. When the port state changes to “up,” the switch detects the client and sends an EAPOL frame. Client access is granted after authentication. Packets from other hosts are dropped. If the client leaves, or is replaced with another client, the switch changes the port link state to “down.” The port is then returned to the unauthorized state.
    
- **Multiple Host Mode:** In multiple-host mode (often called multi-host mode), you can attach multiple hosts to a single 802.1X-enabled port. In this mode, only the first client that attaches clients must be authorized. All subsequent clients are granted network access based on this authentication. If the port becomes unauthorized (reauthentication fails or an EAPOL logoff message is received), the authenticator denies network access to all attached clients.
    
![[Pasted image 20230826173243.png]]

- **Multiple Domain Authentication Mode:** Multidomain Authentication (MDA) mode allows an IP phone and a single host behind the IP phone to authenticate independently via 802.1X, MAB, or web-based (for the host only) authentication. In this application, multidomain refers to two domains (data and voice VLAN). Only one MAC address is allowed per domain. The switch can place the host in the data VLAN and the IP phone in the voice VLAN, but they appear on the same switch port. The data and voice VLAN assignment can be obtained from the VSAs received from the AAA server.
    
- **Multiple Authentication Mode:** Multiple Authentication mode (often called multi-auth mode) allows one 802.1X or MAB client on the voice VLAN. It also allows multiple authenticated 802.1X, MAB, or web authorization clients on the data VLAN. When a hub or access point is connected to an 802.1X port, multi-auth mode provides enhanced security over the multi-hosts mode by requiring authentication of each connected client. For non-802.1X devices, MAB or web-based authentication can be used as the fallback method for individual host authentications, which allows different hosts to be authenticated through different methods on a single port.
    
    In multi-auth mode, the first host that is authorized on the port defines the VLAN assignment, and subsequent hosts will be added to the same VLAN. They may have no VLAN assignment in the RADIUS database, or their configured group VLAN must match the assigned group VLAN on the port. Otherwise, the hosts will be denied access to the port. Furthermore, if the authentication server assigns a dACL, the applied interface ACL will be modified to use the authenticated host’s IP address as the source address. In other words, in multi-auth mode, each host will have a per-host differentiated dACL applied.
    
# Change of Authorization

The AAA framework uses change of authorization (CoA) messages to dynamically modify active subscriber sessions. For example, RADIUS attributes in CoA messages might instruct the framework to create, modify, or terminate a subscriber service.

![[Pasted image 20230826173300.png]]

After successful authentication, an endpoint is allowed basic network connectivity. This basic connectivity profile enables Cisco ISE to perform profiling, security posture functions, and guest services. Once Cisco ISE is aware of a change in the state of an endpoint (for example: an endpoint confirms compliance state), it sends a CoA message to the authenticator and supplies extended access privileges, which are typically described in the form of an appropriate dACL.

# 802.1X Implementation Guidelines

The 802.1X protocol is supported on Layer 2 static access ports, including wired switch ports and wireless access points. It is also supported on voice VLAN ports and Layer 3 routed ports.

![[Pasted image 20230826173310.png]]

802.1X is not supported on these port types:

- **Trunk ports:** If you try to enable 802.1X on a trunk port, an error message appears and 802.1X is not enabled. If you try to change the mode of an 802.1X-enabled port to trunk, an error message appears and the port mode is not changed.
    
- **Dynamic ports:** A port in dynamic mode can negotiate with its neighbor to become a trunk port. Attempts to enable 802.1X on a dynamic port result in an error message and 802.1X is not enabled.
    
- **Dynamic access ports:** Attempts to enable 802.1X on a dynamic access (VLAN Query Protocol) port result in an error message and 802.1X is not enabled. If you try to change an 802.1X-enabled port to dynamic VLAN assignment, an error message appears and the VLAN configuration is not changed.
    
- **EtherChannels:** Do not configure a port that is an active or a not-yet-active member of an EtherChannel as an 802.1X port. If you try to enable 802.1X on an EtherChannel, an error message appears and 802.1X is not enabled.
    
> Note
> In software releases earlier than Cisco IOS Release 12.2(18)SE, if 802.1X is enabled on a not-yet-active port of an EtherChannel, the port does not join the EtherChannel.

In addition to the interface configuration for 802.1X, the protocol needs to be enabled globally on the switch. Before globally enabling 802.1X on a switch, remove the EtherChannel configuration from the interfaces on which both 802.1X and EtherChannel are configured.
