This training describes identity management, which includes a discussion of identity sources - databases of end-user and machine credentials. Identity sources can be both internal and external to the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).

# Identity Sources Overview

Cisco ISE relies on various identity sources to validate credentials and to check group information and other user or endpoint attributes. Cisco ISE supports internal and external identity sources.

The internal identity sources include the following attributes:

- **User:** User identity information can include a username, password, email address, account description, associated administrative group, user group, and role.
    
- **Endpoint:** Endpoint identity information is stored for wired, wireless, or VPN-connected devices. The endpoint identity store typically identifies an endpoint by its MAC address. Stored endpoint attributes may also include other attributes such as platform and OS version.
    

Cisco ISE supports the following external identity sources:

- **LDAP:** LDAP is a standards-based networking protocol that is used to query and modify directory services. LDAP can be used to retrieve user identity from Active Directory servers and older servers such as Sun Directory servers and the NetIQ eDirectory (Novell eDirectory).
    
- **Active Directory (Multi-AD):** Cisco ISE uses Active Directory to access information about users, machines, groups, and attributes. Cisco ISE supports Multi-AD: multiple joins to Active Directory domains without the need for specific trusts between them.
    
- **RADIUS:** A RADIUS identity source is an external collection of subjects and their credentials and uses the RADIUS protocol for communication. Cisco ISE supports any RADIUS RFC 2865-compliant server.
    
- **RSA:** RSA SecurID is a two-factor authentication external authentication server that provides a unique dynamic authentication code for user authentication.
    
- **SAML:** Security Assertion Markup Language Version 2.0 (SAMLv2) enables the exchange of security authentication information between an IdP and a service provider (Cisco ISE).
    
- **Certificate:** Some authentication methods use certificates in addition to, or instead of, password or one-time password (OTP)-based authentication. For example, if you want to use the Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) certificate-based authentication method, it is necessary to create a certificate profile.
    
- **Social Login:** Social login allows guest users to log into the network using their social media credentials.
    
- **ODBC:** An Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)-compliant database can be used as an external identity source to authenticate users and endpoints. ODBC identity sources can be used in an identity store sequence and for guest and sponsor authentications, as well as for BYOD flow. The database engines supported are MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Sybase.
    
# Internal Identity Sources
The internal user database offers a simple way to provision users and endpoints locally on Cisco ISE. This approach does not require any external servers and is thus applicable to testbeds, temporary installations, and very small deployments.

The local database of users and device endpoints is maintained on the primary Policy Administration Node (PAN). The primary PAN synchronizes the database to the secondary PAN and all Policy Service Nodes (PSNs).

For easier management of user accounts, assign users to user groups. User accounts have a set of attributes.

Password is a mandatory parameter of an internal Cisco ISE user. Some protocols, such as Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) or Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (PEAP-TLS), do not use password-based authentication. Therefore, the internal database does not work with these protocols.

The internal database can include device endpoints. This configuration is used for MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB). To enable MAB with the internal Cisco ISE database, you must define endpoints and identify them by their device MAC addresses.

# Configuring Password Policy

To configure password parameters, you will follow the menu path of **Administration > Identity Management > Settings > User Authentication Settings > Password Policy** in the Cisco ISE administrative interface.

The password policy for managing network access per user account offers the following choices:

- **Minimum Length:** This choice sets the minimum length of the password (in characters) between 4 and 127 characters.
    
- **Restrictions:** You can restrict the password from containing the following parameters:
    
    1. The username or its characters in reverse order
        
    2. The word “cisco” or its characters in reverse order
        
    3. An administrator-defined word or its characters in reverse order
        
    4. Any character repeated four or more times consecutively
        
    5. The default Cisco defined dictionary or a custom dictionary of words or their characters in reverse order
        
- **Requirements:** The following can be required as part of the password policy:
    
    1. Lowercase alphanumeric characters
        
    2. Uppercase alphanumeric characters
        
    3. Numeric characters
        
    4. Non-numeric characters
        
- **Password History:** These options can be applied to the password history:
    
    1. Password must be different from the previous versions. This value can be from 3-10.
        
    2. Password change delta in characters, from 3-10. This defines how many characters in the password must be different when changed.
        
    3. How long since a password was used before it can be used. This value can be between 15 and 365 days.
        
- **Password Lifetime:** This choice sets the following options to force users to change passwords after a specified time period:
    
    1. Time before the user account is disabled if the password is not changed. This value is between 1 and 3650 days.
        
    2. Reminder before the user account is disabled. This value is between 1 and 3650 days.
        
    3. Lock/Suspend accounts with incorrect login attempts. This value is between 3 and 20 attempts.
        
# Configuring User and Endpoint Identity Groups
To configure user and endpoint identity groups, you will follow the menu path of **Work Center > Network Access > ID Groups > Endpoint Identity Groups > Add** in the Cisco ISE administrative interface.

Cisco ISE is preconfigured with a set of built-in endpoint and user identity groups. There is a separate list for both endpoints and users. You can edit the built-in groups or define your own custom groups. The only mandatory setting for a group is its name.

# Configuring Users
Once the user groups have been defined, you will configure the user accounts. To configure user accounts, you will follow the menu path of **Work Centers > Network Access > Identities > Network Access Users > Add** in the Cisco ISE administrative interface.
![[Pasted image 20230826173935.png]]

The mandatory user attributes are name, status, and password. The password is checked for all authentication methods that are supported by the internal database. Optional attributes include the email address, user information, account options, an account disable policy, and which groups the user belongs to. Under the account options, you can set a description and require the user to change their password upon the next login.

# Configuring Endpoints

To configure endpoints, you will follow the menu path of **Work Centers > Network Access > Identities > Endpoints** in the Cisco ISE administrative interface.

To deploy MAB using the internal Cisco ISE database, you must identify endpoint MAC addresses. An endpoint will fail MAB authentication if its MAC address is not in the database. You can create endpoints manually or by importing them into the internal Cisco ISE database.

When configuring the endpoint, you can choose an endpoint profiling policy and an identity group. The assignment can either be static or dynamic via the Profiler service. This is enabled by default with the Advantage or Premier license and requires an application restart to enable or disable. The Cisco ISE Profiler service does not reassign the profiling policy and the identity group for statically assigned endpoints.

You have the ability to import endpoints from a comma-separated values (CSV) file. This file lists each endpoint MAC address and its profiling policy which are separated by a comma. The CSV file contains a header row with two columns. Endpoint MAC addresses are in one column, and endpoint profiling policies that are assigned to those endpoints are in the next column.

If the CSV file contains endpoints with their MAC addresses, their assigned endpoint profiling policy is the Unknown profile. Those endpoints are then immediately re-profiled in Cisco ISE to the matching endpoint profiling policies. However, the endpoints are not statically assigned to the Unknown profile. If endpoints do not have profiles that are assigned to them in the CSV file, they are assigned to the Unknown profile. They are then re-profiled to the matching endpoint profiling policies.
