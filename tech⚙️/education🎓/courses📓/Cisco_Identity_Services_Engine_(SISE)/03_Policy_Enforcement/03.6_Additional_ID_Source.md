The Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) can verify user or device identities using several different sources. The ISE internal database and Microsoft Active Directory are the most used identity sources for the enterprise, but there are several others that can be used. These sources can also be put together in a sequence that can be used until an identity is confirmed or not confirmed.

In this training, you will explore several identity sources and how to create an identity source sequence (ISS) that can be used in Cisco ISE authentication rules.

# Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

LDAP is a standards-based networking protocol that is used to query and modify directory services. It is also a lightweight mechanism for accessing an X.500-based directory server. Cisco ISE uses the LDAP protocol to integrate with external LDAP databases.
![[Pasted image 20230826174442.png]]

LDAP natively supports only plain password authentication, which is less secure than most Active Directory methods. To increase protocol security, it is recommended to secure LDAP communications. The LDAP server connection can be secured using two commonly available protocols: LDAP over TLS (STARTTLS) and LDAP over SSL (LDAPS).

The LDAP directory service is based on a client-server model. To start an LDAP session, clients connect and send operation requests to the server, which then responds. One or more LDAP servers contain data from the LDAP directory tree or the LDAP back-end database.

An LDAP directory is organized into a simple tree hierarchy, and it can be distributed among many servers. Each server can have a replicated version of the total directory, which is periodically synchronized.

An entry in the tree contains a set of attributes. Each attribute has a name (an attribute type or attribute description) and one or more values. The attributes are defined in a schema; each entry has a unique identifier that is known as its Distinguished Name (DN), which contains the Relative Distinguished Name (RDN), and is constructed from attributes in the entry and followed by the DN of the parent entry. You can think of the DN as a full filename, and the RDN as a relative filename in a folder.

Cisco ISE has three preconfigured LDAP schemas: Active Directory, Sun Directory Server, and NetIQ eDirectory (Novell eDirectory).

**Active Directory and LDAP Comparison**

You can access the Active Directory database either as an Active Directory or as an LDAP server.

![[Pasted image 20230826174455.png]]

When you connect Cisco ISE to Active Directory via the Active Directory method, you configure an admin user and password with access to the domain. This method provides several advantages such as an extensive attribute range, good performance, and the ability to search up or down the tree.

When you connect to Active Directory as an LDAP server, you configure a user and a search base. This method slows performance, offers fewer attributes, and supports only searching down the tree.

**Integrating Cisco ISE with LDAP**

You can create more than one LDAP instance in Cisco ISE with different IP addresses or port settings. Cisco ISE can thus authenticate by using different LDAP servers or different databases on the same LDAP server. Each primary server IP address and port configuration, along with the secondary server IP address and port configuration, forms an LDAP instance. This instance corresponds to one Cisco ISE LDAP identity source definition.

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|Multiple LDAP Instances|More than one LDAP instance supported Different IP addresses or port settings LDAP instance consists of primary and secondary servers|
|Failover|Failover from primary to secondary server when primary unreachable Primary must be reachable when you configure authorization policies|
|User lookup|Search for a user and retrieve user attributes without authentication|
|MAC address lookup|Search for a MAC address without authentication, if allowed|
|Attributes, group membership, and certificate retrieval|Attribute values, group membership, and certificates can be retrieved from the database with or without authentication|

Cisco ISE does not require each LDAP instance to correspond to a unique LDAP database. There can be more than one LDAP instance set to access the same database, which is useful when your LDAP database contains more than one subtree for users or groups. Each LDAP instance supports only one subtree directory for users and one subtree directory for groups. Therefore, you must configure separate LDAP instances for each user directory subtree and group directory subtree combination for use by Cisco ISE.

Cisco ISE supports failover between primary and secondary LDAP servers. Failover occurs when an authentication request fails because Cisco ISE cannot connect to an LDAP server due to issues such as the server being down or is otherwise unreachable by Cisco ISE. To use the failover feature, you must define the primary and secondary LDAP servers and set the failover settings.

When failover is in use, if Cisco ISE cannot contact the first server, it always attempts to contact the other. The first server that is contacted might not always be the primary LDAP server. The first LDAP server that is contacted depends on the previous LDAP authentication attempts and on the value that you enter in the Failback Retry Delay text box.

> Note
> Because Cisco ISE always uses the primary LDAP server to obtain groups and attributes for use in authorization policies from the user interface, the primary LDAP server must be reachable when you configure these items. Cisco ISE uses the secondary LDAP server only for authentications and authorizations at run time, according to your failover configuration.

To authenticate a user, Cisco ISE sends a bind request to the LDAP server. The bind request contains the user’s distinguished name and password in cleartext. A user is authenticated when their distinguished name and password match an entry in the LDAP directory.

Cisco ISE supports the user lookup feature, which allows you to search for a user in the LDAP database and retrieve information, without authentication. The user lookup process includes the following actions:

- The LDAP server is searched for an entry that matches the username in the request. 
- The group membership information of the user is retrieved for use in policies.
- Values are retrieved for the attributes that you have specified for use in policies and authorization profiles.
    
Cisco ISE also supports the MAC address lookup feature. This feature allows you to search for a MAC address in the LDAP database and retrieve information without authentication. The MAC address lookup process includes the following actions:

- The LDAP server is searched for an entry that matches the MAC address of the device.
- The group information for the device is retrieved for use in policies.
- Values are retrieved for the attributes that you have specified for use in policies.
    

Furthermore, you can configure Cisco ISE to retrieve attribute values, group membership, and certificates with or without authentication.

# RADIUS
A RADIUS server supports the RADIUS protocol and provides authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services to users and devices. A RADIUS server can act as an external identity source with a collection of subjects and their credentials. The RADIUS protocol is used to communicate with a RADIUS server.

![[Pasted image 20230826174628.png]]

Cisco ISE supports any standards-compliant RADIUS server as an external identity source, including the RSA SecurID server and the SafeWord server. The SafeWord token server can contain several users and their credentials as one-time passwords. Cisco ISE can query this identity store via the RADIUS protocol.

For redundance, RADIUS is configured with a primary server and a secondary server. If the primary server times out on a RADIUS request, Cisco ISE will send the request to the secondary server.

The RADIUS server can provide password-based authentication with RADIUS PAP, or token-based authentication using PEAP with inner EAP-GTC or EAP-FAST with inner EAP-GTC. Examples of supported RADIUS token server implementations include RSA SecurID and the SafeWord server.

RADIUS identity sources use the same UDP port for authentication sessions as they do for all RADIUS communication. For Cisco ISE to successfully send RADIUS messages to a RADIUS-enabled server, you must ensure that the gateway devices between the RADIUS-enabled server and Cisco ISE allow communication over the same UDP port.

**RADIUS Integration Procedure**

To integrate Cisco ISE with a RADIUS server, follow the menu path of **Administration > Identity Management > External Identity Sources > RADIUS Token – Add** in the Cisco ISE administrative interface.

![[Pasted image 20230826174639.png]]

Then, you will enter the following information:
- Server name
- Server connection
    1. Type of the token server
    2. High-availability settings
    3. Primary and secondary server parameters
- Authentication settings (optional)
- Authorization settings (optional)

# SAMLv2
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML-based open standard data format. SAML enables you to access a defined set of applications seamlessly after signing into one of those applications.

SAML describes the exchange of security-related information between trusted business partners. It enables the exchange of security authentication information between an identity provider (Azure Active Directory) and a service provider (Cisco ISE).

![[Pasted image 20230826174712.png]]

SAML facilitates single sign-on (SSO). SSO allows for authentication responsibility to be transferred from Cisco ISE to a third-party system. Cisco ISE can use SSO for web-based authentications to network resources and to various ISE portals.

The basic steps in an SSO authentication using Azure Active Directory and Web Authentication (WebAuth) for wireless network access are as follows:

1. The user connects to an open SSID.
2. Cisco ISE sends a URL redirect sending the user to the ISE guest portal for authentication.
3. When the user selects the option to use SSO for authentication, Cisco ISE sends a redirect URL sending the user to the Microsoft login page.
4. After Cisco ISE confirms the authentication, it sends a Change of Authorization (CoA) to the wireless LAN controller (WLC), removing the URL redirect and any access restrictions.
5. The client accesses the network.

The identity provider stores and validates the user credentials and generates a SAML response that grants user access to the resources defined by the service provider. Authentication information is secured by encryption, and Cisco ISE and the identity provider are authenticated by certificates. Some SSO identity providers, such as Azure Active Directory, allow for two-factor authentication to be enforced.

SAML SSO establishes a Circle of Trust (CoT) by exchanging metadata and certificates as part of the provisioning process between the identity provider and the service provider. The service provider trusts the identity provider user information to provide access to the various services or applications.

Cisco ISE supports the following identity providers:
- Oracle Access Manager (OAM)
- Oracle Identity Federation (OIF)
- SecureAuth
- PingIdentity
- PingFederate
- Azure Active Directory
    
SAML SSO is supported for the following portals:
- Guest portal (sponsored and self-registered)
- Sponsor portal
- My Devices portal
- Certificate Provisioning portal
- Admin portal (Beginning with Cisco ISE version 3.1)
    

> Note
> For BYOD support, select an identity provider for a guest portal and enable BYOD flow.

# Identity Source Sequence
Identity source sequences define the order in which Cisco ISE seeks user credentials in different databases. If you store user information in more than one database, you can define the order in which you want Cisco ISE to check these databases for user information. When a match is found, Cisco ISE does not look further. It evaluates the credentials and returns the result to the user. This policy is a “first match” policy.

![[Pasted image 20230826174806.png]]

However, you can configure Cisco ISE behavior for situations when a certain database cannot be accessed. The two available settings are “continue to search other databases” or “stop processing altogether.”

For example, if there is an identity source sequence of three databases: Active Directory, LDAP, and an internal identity store, when a user is not found in the Active Directory database, Cisco ISE proceeds to search the second source—LDAP. If the LDAP server is down, and the option “Proceed to the next store in the sequence” is configured, Cisco ISE falls back to the third identity source option. Because the user is found in this database, and the credentials match, authentication succeeds.

**Identity Source Sequence in Simple Authentication Flow**

By default, after an identity source being used cannot be accessed, processing stops and Cisco ISE will not access other stores in the sequence. This behavior will cause the Authentication Status to be set to “Process Error.” To enable rollover, you must set the advanced search list setting to “Treat as if the user was not found and process to the next store in the sequence” when configuring the ISS.

![[Pasted image 20230826174820.png]]

The preceding diagram illustrates the authentication flow using an identity source sequence in a simple authentication process. The key aspect of the flow is that when the user is not found in a particular identity source, the authentication is attempted using the next source in the sequence.

**Configuring Identity Source Sequences**
To add identity source sequences, follow the menu path of **Administration > Identity Management > Identity Source Sequences** in the Cisco ISE administrative interface.

![[Pasted image 20230826174834.png]]

The preceding figure shows the addition of a new ISS that looks at the Active Directory abc.public before looking at the internal user database. Available identity sources are listed on the left and selected sources are on the right. In this case, the internal user store will be checked after the Active Directory store.

Notice the Advanced Search List Settings section at the bottom. These two options define the behavior when the database is not accessible:

- **Do Not Access Other Stores in the Sequence:** This option is the default method and causes Cisco ISE to stop processing the list.
    
- **Treat as if the User Was Not Found and Proceed to the Next Store in the Sequence:** This method enables failover to the next source if the database is not reachable.
