# Actions
## Data Storage and Processing Providers
#cisp #dsp
- [ ] **Identify current** Northern Health 3rd-party Data Storage and processing (DSP) providers
- [ ] **Update the register** of Critical Infrastructure Assets via *CISC online portal* (Cyber and Infrastructure Security Centre) and **Notify** current DSP's 
- [ ] A process to **identify new** DSP's

## Policies, Procedures and Practices
Enhancement of **policies**, **procedures** and **practices**
### Processes
#ascs #incident_response #cirmp
1.  [ ] Cyber Security *incident reporting* to [ACSC](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism/cyber-security-guidelines/guidelines-cyber-security-incidents) 
2.  [ ] A *workplan* to support *implementation* of the *CIRMP* (Critical Infrastructure Risk Management Program) rules.
3.  [ ] A *register* of policies, procedures and practices that addresses the CIRMP rules for each [hazard](#Hazards)
	- or separate document that outlines NH's approach to managing each [hazard](#Hazards)

## Critical Infrastructure Assets


# Gap Analysis
## Register of Critical Infrastructure Assets
- [ ] Lack of a formal process to *report a notifiable event* to the secretary within 30 days
## DSP providers
- [ ] NH DSP providers are not fully identified, and there's need to update the register of CI assets via CISC portal, and have a process to identify new DSP providers e.g. as part of vendor onboarding, etc.
	- NH has a *Critical Infrastructure Applications Register* which can be used to notify DSP providers.
## Cyber Security incidents
- [ ] a process to notify ACSC of significant CS incidents, including roles and responsibilities.
	- NH has an informal process
## CIRMP
- NH has established a *Risk Management Framework* for legislative compliance. 
	- [ ] Needs to be aligned with CIRMP rules
## Cyber and Information Security Hazards
- NH has developed an *ICT - Operational Manual* and *Draft ICT - Internal Emergency Procedure* to minimise impact of CS incidents
	- [ ] Continue with implementing initiatives to address DoH maturity level 1 deficiencies.
	- [ ] Formalise *Draft ICT - Internal Emergency Procedure*
## Personnel Hazards
## Supply Chain Hazards
## Physical and Natural Hazards

## Annual reporting regarding NH CIRMP within 90 days of EOFY
- [ ] lack of a mechanism to capture hazards that impact NH
- [ ] lack of a formal process to submit an annual report

## Material Risks
