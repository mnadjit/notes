How to use the debug executables
--------------------------------

The debug executables found in this directory ({app}\bin\debug) 
have identical functionality to the production executables 
found in {app}\bin, but are laced with assertions, debugging 
code, and memory tracking. 

These executables run significantly slower than the production 
versions, but may give more informative error messages in case 
of system failures, and report exception stack dumps and memory leaks. 
Mostly these are only of use to the HL7Connect support team, 
so the debug executables should only be used at their request.

To run the debug versions, follow this procedure:

  #1 make a backup copy of the files HL7Connect.exe, hl7dev.exe
     and HL7ConnectTypeLibrary.dll found in the {app}\bin directory
  
  #2 stop the HL7Connect Service and Close the 
     HL7 Development Environment, and any other processes that
     might be using the Type Library
  
  #3 copy the .exe, .dll, and .map files from the {app}\bin\debug 
     directory into the {app}\bin directory
   
  #4 start the HL7Connect service and/or the 
     HL7 Development Environment

	 
To reverse the changes:

  #1 stop the HL7Connect Service and Close the 
     HL7 Development Environment, and any other processes that
     might be using the Type Library
  
  #2 delete any files that exist in the {app}\bin\debug 
     directory from the {app}\bin directory
   
  #3 restore HL7Connect.exe, hl7dev.exe and HL7ConnectTypeLibrary.dll
     from the backup directory you made in the original 
     procedure above
  
  #4 start the HL7Connect service and/or the 
     HL7 Development Environment


Note: you can change the binaries from production to debug independently. 
All debug executables need FastMM_FullDebugMode.dll.
