## Rhapsody 7 
	- not using log4j - uses LogBack instead which is similar but slightly different
		- No fatal log levels
		- properties files are different
	- support for some old OSs are being removed e.g. 32bits
	- Rhapsody API SOAP is being removed - only REST. This is only regarding the Rhapsody API, and SOAP commpoints will remain supported
	- xml designer is being removed
	- versioning is changing to Semantic versioning like 7.0.0 beta
	- gRPC getting used in the backend instead of HTTP
	
	### JavaScript
		- Rhino version is 12 years old and is being removed 
		- moving to use GRAAL (https://www.graalvm.org/22.1/reference-manual/js/) which supports E4X (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript_for_XML)  
		- Rhapsody 7 will have Rhino JS filter, as well as GRAAL filter, for backward compatibility
		- JSON parsing will be improved for large files - in Rhapsody 6 it's slow
		
	### 7.1
		- ability to upgrade from Rhino filter to GRAAL
		
	- OAuth 2.0 built in
	- TLS 1.3	supported
	
	- Plan for having enhanced code editor and probably debugger! in future subversions. Not in 7.0 :-(
	
	- easier to deploy rhapsody in containers - currently possible with 6.9 and 6.10 in docker
