Managing identities in the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) internal database puts management and performance constraints on your company’s identity services. Using external repositories to store user accounts and attributes reduces the workload on the ISE administrator and expands the identity resources that can be utilized. In this training, you will review external authentication and explore how Cisco ISE integrates with Microsoft Active Directory to store user accounts and attributes.

# External Authentication
Most companies deploy a scalable authentication framework, with external repositories that store user accounts and attributes. This process allows multiple systems to access a single, centralized database, and request desired information. The external identity source is configured in a redundant way to provide a highly available authentication solution.

Consider the following items when configuring Cisco ISE to use an external identity source:

- Cisco ISE can authenticate clients against a single authentication source or a sequence of authentication sources.
    
- The supported external authentication sources include Active Directory, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), RADIUS, Secure RSA servers, and SAML identity providers. You can also validate users via a certificate service, and via social media credentials.
    
- You can also make use of Open DataBase Connectivity (ODBC)-compliant database services such as MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL server, and others. For more information about using an ODBC-compliant database as an external identity source, refer to the Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 2.2 or later, in the chapter entitled “Manage Users and External Identity Sources.”
    
- Cisco ISE allows you to configure Active Directory and LDAP servers with an IPv4 or an IPv6 address when you manually add the attribute type “IP” and authenticate the user.
    
- Cisco ISE does _not_ support servers that reside behind a network address translator and have a NAT address. Reference the latest Cisco ISE Administrator Guide for more information about prerequisites for integrating Microsoft Active Directory with Cisco ISE, including required open ports.
    

# Active Directory Overview
![[Pasted image 20230826174128.png]]

Active Directory is a repository for network users and device information. It is a widely deployed directory structure that includes a hierarchical format, logical groups of users or devices, and allows administrators to assign permissions to users, network devices, and object groups.

When integrating Cisco ISE with Active Directory, keep in mind that Active Directory requires accurate time. The Cisco ISE and domain controller time must be within 5 minutes of each other. If the clock on Cisco ISE is more than 5 minutes different than the Active Directory clock, ISE might be removed from the domain and identity verification will fail. Using the same Network Time Protocol (NTP) time source as Active Directory uses is highly recommended.

If there is a firewall between Cisco ISE and the Active Directory, you must ensure that communication between ISE and the Active Directory is not blocked. On the firewall, ensure that all ports relevant to Active Directory communication are open, and ensure that Network Address Translation (NAT) is not used.

Identity information is stored in Active Directory as individual entities known as objects. Objects describe network entities such as servers, printers, client PCs, and user accounts. This directory structure allows you to group objects that share similar permissions, function, or location. User and device permissions are based on configured corporate policies.

Active Directory uses a tree-like topology structure that is similar to Domain Name System (DNS). Active Directory includes the following layers:

- **Forest:** The top level of Active Directory. The forest contains one or more trees, and any objects within the same forest share the same global catalog, directory schema, logical structure, and directory configuration.
    
- **Tree:** A tree is a collection of one or more domains that share trusted relationships.
    
- **Domain:** A domain is a grouping of objects that share the same database. A domain can contain various objects that are logically grouped as organizational units.
    
- **Organizational Unit:** An organizational unit is a logical grouping of objects within the domain. Organizational units are organized based on the network design. They can be collections of users in the same corporate group, servers in the same cluster, printers on the same floor, or any other grouping of corporate significance.
    
- **Object:** An object in Active Directory is any user, client PC, network server, printer, or other device that is integrated within the directory.
    

# Active Directory-Supported Authentication Methods
Active Directory supports common methods used for authenticating network access.

![[Pasted image 20230826174143.png]]

When using Active Directory as the external authentication source, Cisco ISE supports the following authentication protocols:
- Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)    
- Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol versions 1 and 2 (MS-CHAPv1, MS-CHAPv2)
- Extensible Authentication Protocol variations (EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, LEAP, EAP-FAST, PEAP, and EAP-GTC)
# Integrating Cisco ISE with Active Directory
Cisco ISE uses Active Directory as an external identity source to access resources such as users, machines, groups, and attributes. You can configure Cisco ISE to authenticate users and machines.

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|User authentication|Access permission for users listed in the directory|
|Machine authentication|Access permission for devices listed in the directory|
|Attribute retrieval for authorization|Cisco ISE user or machine Active Directory attributes are in the authorization rule conditions Authorization attributes can be retrieved independently of authentication|

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|Group retrieval for authorization|Cisco ISE can use Active Directory group data for authorization Retrieved groups can be referenced in authorization rule conditions Cannot authorize based on organizational units|
|User access restrictions|Attributes such as enabled/disabled, account expired, locked out, and allowed login times are retrieved|

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|User authentication|Access permission for users listed in the directory|
|Machine authentication|Access permission for devices listed in the directory|
|Attribute retrieval for authorization|Cisco ISE user or machine Active Directory attributes are in the authorization rule conditions Authorization attributes can be retrieved independently of authentication|
|Group retrieval for authorization|Cisco ISE can use Active Directory group data for authorization Retrieved groups can be referenced in authorization rule conditions Cannot authorize based on organizational units|
|User access restrictions|Attributes such as enabled/disabled, account expired, locked out, and allowed login times are retrieved|

# Multidomain Join Points in Active Directory

Cisco ISE supports integration with multiple Active Directory domains without requiring you to establish trust relationships between those domains.

![[Pasted image 20230826174221.png]]

This feature that allows Cisco ISE to join independent Active Directory servers is sometimes referred to as join points. You can configure one-way trust relationships and use multiple credentials to establish these join points.

![[Pasted image 20230826174235.png]]

Cisco ISE supports configuration of up to 200 Active Directory servers without a “two-way trust” existing between them. With this configuration, Cisco ISE can join multiple domains simultaneously, each with a one-way trust, while bypassing any permission issues.

With multidomain join capabilities, you can have a set of separate Active Directory domains. Each domain has their own groups, attributes, corresponding authorization policies, and multiple dictionaries for each separate join.

# Identity Rewrite
Identity Rewrite is an advanced feature that allows Cisco ISE to modify the username for an incoming request and send it to Active Directory in the required format. It can also rewrite identities in certificates and process requests that have incorrectly provisioned certificates. The same identity rewrite rules are applicable for incoming usernames or machine names, whether they originate from client or from within certificates.

![[Pasted image 20230826174259.png]]

The Identity Rewrite option can solve ambiguity issues and can include or exclude a domain prefix or other markup of your choice. For example, **domain1.local\msmith** can be rewritten as **msmith@domain.local**.

When identity rewrite rules are engaged, the adjusted subject identity passes from the identity store component in Cisco ISE to the Active Directory connector for all interactions for that session. These interactions include subject searches, authentication, and authorization queries. Cisco ISE will match the condition tokens. When the first token is matched, the processing of the policy is terminated and the identity string is rewritten according to the result.

Identity rewrite rules always apply within the context of an Active Directory join point. Even if a scope is selected as the result of an authentication policy, the rewrite rules are applied for each Active Directory join point.

# Active Directory Diagnostics
The Cisco ISE Diagnostic Tool functions as a step-by-step guide to fix problems. The service runs on every Cisco ISE node that has joined the Active Directory domain and it allows you to execute tests that detect issues that may cause functionality or performance issues.

![[Pasted image 20230826174310.png]]

There are multiple reasons why Cisco ISE might be unable to join or authenticate against Active Directory. The Diagnostic Tool ensures that the prerequisites for connecting Cisco ISE to Active Directory are configured correctly. It also detects problems with networking, firewall configurations, clock sync, user authentication, and so on.

Tests performed by the Cisco ISE Diagnostic Tool include:

- **Kerberos check SASL connectivity to Active** **Directory:** Checks secure connectivity to Active Directory using the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanism.    
- **Kerberos test obtaining join point TGT:** Tests the Ticket Granting Tickets (TGT) obtaining process in a join point.

To use the Cisco ISE Diagnostic Tool to troubleshoot issues, access the ISE administrative interface and perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to **Administration > Identity Management > External Identity Sources > Active Directory**.    
2. Click the **Advanced Tools** drop-down and choose **Diagnostic Tool**.
3. (Optional) Select a Cisco ISE node on which to run the diagnosis. If you do not select a Cisco ISE node, then the test runs on all the nodes.
4. (Optional) Select a specific Active Directory join point. If you do not select an Active Directory join point, then the test runs on all the join points.
5. Click **Run All Tests** on node to start the test.
6. Once the test is complete, click the link that is provided to view the summary for tests with a Warning or Failed status. A table contains the full status from the previous tests that were run on Cisco ISE node. It also allows you to rerun specific tests, to stop running tests, and to view a report of specific tests.
