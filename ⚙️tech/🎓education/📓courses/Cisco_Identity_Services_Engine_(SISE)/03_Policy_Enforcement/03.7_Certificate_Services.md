This training begins with an overview of digital certificates, then explores the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) certificate services, and describes how Cisco ISE uses them. Upon completion of this training, you will be able to describe certificate usage in Cisco ISE, as well as key features provided by Cisco ISE Certificate Authority (CA) services.

# Certificate Overview
Certificates are a used by the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). PKI is designed to securely distribute public key information. This authentication framework is based on private and public key pairs. Public key authenticity is guaranteed by a Certificate Authority (CA).

Cisco ISE supports password and certificate-based user authentication. Some authentication methods use a mixed approach. Mixed approaches use multiple credential types to achieve bi-directional authentication between the client and the server, such as passwords, one-time passwords (OTPs), and certificates.

For nearly all EAP methods, such as Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) and Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol-Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2 (PEAP-MSCHAPv2), the client validates the network by checking validity of the Cisco ISE authentication server certificate.

For PEAP-MSCHAPv2, the network validates the client via username and password credentials, and therefore, you only need certificates for server-side devices like Cisco ISE.

However, for EAP-TLS, the client validates the network by checking the Cisco ISE server-side certificate and the network validates the client by checking the client’s certificate. Therefore, you must generate and distribute certificates for every client device, in addition to each authentication server.

**Client Certificate Verification**
For some EAP methods, including EAP-TLS, PEAP-TLS, and optionally EAP-FAST, clients can use certificates to prove their identity.

![[Pasted image 20230826175057.png]]

For the client to have a certificate that it can use for identity services, you must access your CA service to generate client certificates and then distribute them to clients. If you do not have a local CA to use, you may be able to use Cisco ISE as a CA.

Additionally, you must distribute the CA server’s root certificate to Cisco ISE to trust the clients’ certificates.

During authentication, Cisco ISE requests that the client proves its identity. The client provides its certificate and Cisco ISE compares this certificate against its stored copy of the CA root certificate. Cisco ISE extracts the public key of the CA root certificate and uses it to validate the CA signature in the received client identity certificate.

**Certificate Authentication Profiles**

Certificate authentication profiles are used in authentication policies for certificate-based authentications to verify user authenticity. Certificate authentication profiles enable an additional client authentication feature. This feature is performed after the TLS session has been established and after the client certificate has been verified.

![[Pasted image 20230826175115.png]]

Certificate authentication profiles include the following information:

- The certificate field that should be used as the principal username
- An indicator of whether a binary comparison of the certificate should be performed

![[Pasted image 20230826175129.png]]

Certificate authentication profiles allow you to perform the following actions:

- Specify which certificate field should be used as the principal username. Using this option, Cisco ISE verifies if the specified field matches the same value as the username in the identity source. You can set this value to the Common Name, Subject Alternative Name, Subject Serial Number, Subject, Other Name, Email, or DNS.
    
- Specify if a binary comparison of the certificate should be performed. If this option is enabled, Cisco ISE retrieves the user certificate from the identity source. Cisco ISE compares it, based on each octet, with the received client certificate. Client certificates can be retrieved from the Active Directory or LDAP Identity Stores.
    

**Certificate Implementation Procedure**
![[Pasted image 20230826175139.png]]

There are three steps in the certificate implementation procedure:

1. **Step 1:** Install the server certificate. This step is described as a post-deployment configuration task. If you check the EAP check box after the installation of the certificate, the certificate will be used as the server-side certificate for client EAP sessions. Cisco ISE can only use one certificate for EAP services. If selected, it will remove that designation from the previously configured certificate.
2. **Step 2:** Deploy client certificates. This step is not explained in detail because its deployment depends on the specific PKI environment in your enterprise. This is typically done as part of the corporate AD policy, or manually on the client.
3. **Step 3:** Configure certificate authentication profiles (Optional). There is a default certificate authentication template provided by Cisco that will work for most cases, but custom profiles can be defined and applied to specific identity sources as needed.
    

To get a CA-signed Cisco ISE certificate, Cisco ISE first generates a certificate signing request (CSR), which must be submitted to the enterprise CA. The CA then issues the identity certificate for Cisco ISE. Finally, the Cisco ISE identity certificate, which is called the CA-signed certificate, must be bound to the initial CSR.

Configuration options allow you to enable the certificate for the following use cases:
- **EAP – Use Certificate for EAP Protocols that Use SSL/TLS Tunneling:** This setting enables the Cisco ISE identity certificate to be presented to the clients in EAP connections.
- **Admin – Use Certificate to Authenticate the ISE admin portal:** This setting activates the Cisco ISE identity certificate to secure management HTTPS sessions.
- **pxGrid – Use Certificate for pxGrid controller:** This setting activates the Cisco ISE identity certificate for pxGrid.
- **SAML – Use for Certificate for Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) single sign-on (SSO).**
- **Portal – Use for portal:** This setting activates the Cisco ISE identity certificate for use with different portals, such as the Native Supplicant Provisioning (NSP) portal.

As an alternative to installing the certificate from an external CA, you can use the Cisco ISE pre-installed, self-signed certificate. Again, this usage is discouraged for an enterprise-class solution because it reduces security and scalability, but it might be beneficial in small deployments and test bed systems. Keep in mind, endpoints must be explicitly configured to trust this self-signed certificate.

**Certificate Authentication Profile Configuration**
As explained previously, certificate authentication profiles allow additional authentication granularity for certificate-based user authentications.

To configure certificate authentication profiles, follow the menu path of **Administration > Identity Management > External Identity Sources > Certificate Authentication Profile** in the Cisco ISE administrative interface.

![[Pasted image 20230826175224.png]]

You can specify the certificate field to be used as the principal username. In the preceding figure, it is set to Common Name (CN). The Cisco ISE will verify that the certificate Common Name value is the same as the username in the identity source.

The figure also illustrates how to perform a binary comparison of the certificate. Cisco ISE will retrieve the user certificate from the Active Directory database and compare it, based on each octet, with the received client certificate. In the figure shown, the configuration is set to perform a binary comparison only to resolve any identity ambiguity issues that occur during the lookup process.

# Certification Authority (CA) Services
In some cases when implementing authentication, there may be certain services that require the use of a CA in your network. If you do not already have a CA implemented, Cisco ISE can serve as a CA.

![[Pasted image 20230826175235.png]]

If you have devices connecting to your network that are requiring certificates for 802.1X authentication, but do not have an AD environment, or are not using AD as a CA, Cisco ISE can validate and sign CSRs for these endpoints.

Cisco ISE generates and securely stores keys and certificates issued to users and devices on the PAN and PSNs. It allows the administrator to verify certificates from the Admin GUI and can also respond to Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) requests to validate certificates.

![[Pasted image 20230826175255.png]]

The internal Cisco ISE Certificate Authority (ISE CA) issues and manages digital certificates for endpoints from a centralized console. You can use this function with "bring your own device" (BYOD) services to allow employees to use their personal devices on the company network. The Primary Administration Node is the Root CA, node CA, subordinate CA, and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responder certificate. The Policy Service Nodes (PSNs) are subordinate CAs to the Policy Administration Node (PAN) Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol Registration Authority (SCEP RA).

> Note
> You may need an endpoint to authenticate to your network by using a certificate issued by Cisco ISE CA from another deployment. To do so, you must import the Cisco ISE root CA, node CA, and endpoint sub CA certificates from that deployment into the Cisco ISE Trusted Certificates store.

**Certificate Templates**
Certificate templates contain properties common to all CA issued certs for specific services. The internal Cisco ISE CA uses a certificate template to issue certificates based on that template.

To configure certificate templates, follow the menu path of **Administration > System > Certificates > Certificate Authority > Certificate Templates** in the Cisco ISE administrative interface.

![[Pasted image 20230826175312.png]]

The certificate template defines the Subject, Subject Alternative Name (SAN), key type, key size, Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol Registration Authority (SCEP RA) profile that must be used, validity period of the certificate, and the Extended Key Usage (EKU). The EKU specifies whether the certificate must be used for client or server authentication or both.

![[Pasted image 20230826175343.png]]

Cisco ISE comes with the three default certificate templates for the Cisco ISE CA. Additional templates are created when necessary.

**External CA Settings**
Cisco ISE can be configured with external CA settings to facilitate SCEP RA support for VPN and BYOD usage.

![[Pasted image 20230826175355.png]]

Cisco ISE supports SCEP. This feature enables certificate provisioning functions for a variety of mobile devices that users can register on a network. VPN gateways such as the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) may use SCEP to enroll with the Cisco ISE CA and support VPN client connections. These clients will have also received their end entity certificates from the Cisco ISE CA.

![[Pasted image 20230826175407.png]]

Cisco ISE enables the configuration of one or more SCEP RA profiles to point Cisco ISE to multiple CA locations and are referred to as Cisco ISE External CA Settings. The benefit of allowing multiple profiles is to help ensure high availability and perform load balancing across specified CA locations.

**Certificate Provisioning Portal**
The Cisco ISE Certificate Provisioning portal allows employees to request certificates for devices that cannot go through the onboarding flow and must have certificates issued manually.

![[Pasted image 20230826175420.png]]

These devices include Linux-based systems, point-of-sale (PoS) terminals, or devices with embedded Windows. The Certificate Provisioning portal allows a privileged set of users to upload a certificate request for such devices, generate key pairs (if required), and download the certificate.

Employees access the portal by following the menu path of **Administration > Device Portal Management > Certificate Provisioning** in the Cisco ISE administrative interface. From the portal, they can request a single certificate or make a bulk certificate request using a CSV file.

![[Pasted image 20230826175433.png]]

Certificate provisioning steps are the following:
1. Configure authorized groups (AdminUI)
2. Configure certificate templates (Admin UI)
3. Portal test URL (Admin UI)
4. Log in and go through AUP and Post Access Banner (if configured)
5. Choose certificate generation method
6. Fill in required input
7. Generate certificate
8. Download certificate and private key (if applicable)
9. Install certificate and private key on device (not detailed)
