As a general rule, the more information fed into the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Profiler service, the better. But collecting data from too many sources can provide duplicated data, or data that is not beneficial to the Profiler service itself. This superfluous data can cause processing overhead that negatively impacts the Profiler performance and/or does not actually provide any additional benefit over data that has been provided from other sources.

This training will cover some of the best practices for implementing the profiler service in an ISE deployment.

# General Profile Design Planning

Before you deploy profiling, some basic planning can be helpful. First, identify the endpoints you intend to authorize before allowing them access. These endpoints are devices that require classification to provide authorization based on profile attributes.

![[Pasted image 20230903182003.png]]

Next, use the existing ISE profiles to determine which attributes you should collect from the endpoints:

- Explore the prebuilt profiles in Cisco ISE for Android, iOS devices, Windows-based PCs, and more.
    
- Review the conditions that are used in prebuilt profiles to classify endpoints:
    
    1. If one condition in a profile is based on the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI), then you must collect the MAC address for endpoints. MAC addresses are a key part of profiling.
        
    2. If a condition relies on certain identification string information, then you must collect HTTP data.
        

Sometimes, there is no prebuilt profile that accurately identifies your device and it will require you to build a custom profile to properly classify the device. If there is no existing profile for your device:

- Disable the Endpoint Attribute Filter if it has been enabled.
    
- Enable profiling probes and collect data.
    
- Observe how the device is profiled by the default Cisco ISE profiling service.
    
- If required, resort to packet capture to understand the details about how your device interacts with the network.
    

With the knowledge you have gained, you can then determine the best way to collect the required information. Perhaps RADIUS, HTTP, Domain Name System (DNS), or DHCP probes with the Device Sensor features of a legacy Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) are appropriate. For other environments, a different set of probes may be appropriate.

# Guide to Probe Selection

There are often several different methods that are available to capture the same profiling-related endpoint data. Assessing all available endpoint collection methods will help you answer the following questions:

- Which probes are the easiest and most difficult to deploy?
    
- Which probes have the least and highest impact on my network?
    
- What is the general value that this probe adds to my ability to profile my endpoints?
    
- And most importantly, which probes apply to my use case?
    

![[Pasted image 20230903182016.png]]

The Probe Usefulness Index is a guide to help interpret the Probe Suitability tables that will follow. The index offers three metrics and their severity levels on which to base probe selection:

- **DDI:** The Deployment Difficulty Index indicates how difficult it is to deploy a particular probe.
    
- **NII:** The Network Impact Index (NII) indicates how much additional overhead the probe adds to your network. This overhead includes bandwidth utilization on network links, and memory and CPU utilization on Cisco ISE nodes, Network Access Devices (NADs), and other network devices.
    
- **PVI:** The Probe Value Index (PVI) indicates the level of value that this probe adds to your particular environment.
    

Note that the severity levels of each metric are indicated by color: green, yellow, and red, with red being most severe. Use this information to interpret the following Probe Suitability tables.

# Probe Suitability—Cisco IOS Network

You can choose the appropriate probes for your network based on the information supplied in the following table. Keep in mind the color designations defined in the probe usefulness index.

![[Pasted image 20230903182027.png]]

The RADIUS probe has a very low impact on network resources, is easy to deploy, and adds great value by gathering MAC and IP addresses and usernames. These capabilities facilitate gleaning the network interface card (NIC) OUI and, more importantly, the MAC-to-IP address mapping. This probe is fundamental for device detection and for enabling other probes.

You can also enable your Cisco access switches’ Device Sensor feature along with the RADIUS probe due to its high value and low network impact. The deployment difficulty rises a bit, but only because you must enter a few CLI commands on your switches.

Probes that you are likely better off avoiding include NetFlow, Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN), and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Trap. Avoid these probes due to their relatively low value and high network impact.

Usefulness of the remaining probes will often depend on your specific needs.

# Probe Suitability—Legacy Wireless Network

You can make probe selections for wireless networks based on the information from the following table. As with Cisco IOS probe suitability, the RADIUS probe is very useful, along with the Device Sensor features of your Cisco legacy WLC.

![[Pasted image 20230903182110.png]]

DHCP probes can also be valuable. You will likely need to configure helper addresses on endpoint default gateways for this type of probe to work. The HTTP probe is appropriate when you must distinguish between various mobile device types.

Probes that involve NetFlow or SPAN functions create a much higher network impact than other methods. In addition, most of the functions are of low value anyway. While they may add value sometimes, if there is another method that gets the same data, use it instead.

# Device Sensors for Legacy Wireless

The Device Sensor for legacy Cisco wireless provides a very low-impact, high-value data collection method. The Device Sensor sends data in RADIUS accounting messages to Policy Service Nodes (PSNs) so make sure that the RADIUS profiling probe is enabled on the PSNs.

![[Pasted image 20230903182124.png]]

HTTP and DHCP sensors are highly recommended for wireless devices because they can determine a wide range of wireless endpoints. The HTTP Profiling probe and the DHCP IP helper option are enabled on a per-WLAN basis.

The DHCP IP helper option allows the collection of a broader range of DHCP options than in the case of DHCP proxy utilization. Therefore, the general recommendation is to disable DHCP proxy and enable IP helper on the WLC or access point.

The Device Sensor for DHCP is limited to providing only DHCP option 12 (**host-name**) and option 60 (**dhcp-class-identifier**). It cannot provide information for other DHCP options. For example, you cannot get DHCP options 55 (**dhcp-parameter-request-list**) and 77 (**user-class-id**).

If you need to capture DHCP attributes other than just DHCP option 12 and option 60, disable DHCP proxy on the Cisco WLC to allow the forwarding of DHCP via IP Helpers.

To disable DHCP proxy, navigate to **Controller > Advanced > DHCP** on the Cisco WLC. Then configure IP helper addresses on each user WLAN gateway interface where you desire profiling. You will include the real DHCP server and the IP address of the profiling PSN.

# HTTP and DHCP VACL Capture

The SPAN probe is resource-intensive and you should avoid using it to collect HTTP and DHCP information.

![[Pasted image 20230903182138.png]]

Alternatively, you can configure VLAN access control lists (VACLs) on the network access devices (NADs) and capture only DHCP and HTTP traffic. This usage limits the amount of traffic coming to PSNs for analysis.

As shown in the figure, the switch is configured to only capture HTTP traffic and forward it out the appropriate port to the Cisco ISE PSN.

# HTTP and DHCP Probes

HTTP and DHCP probes are two of the most important probes that you will use to collect attributes in your network. With the HTTP probe, it is recommended to use URL redirects rather than SPAN or RSPAN. URL redirection centralizes data collection and reduces traffic load.

![[Pasted image 20230903182202.png]]

If you must use SPAN or RSPAN, be on the lookout for typical choke points or network bottlenecks. These areas include the Internet edge and perhaps connections to the Cisco WLCs. Remember, it is best to only use this method in scenarios where there is no URL redirection in play. Use a VACL to limit the impact of this probe.

With the DHCP probe, use IP helpers whenever possible and remember that Layer 3 devices that act as DHCP servers will not relay DHCP for their own IP address assignments.

As always, avoid DHCP SPAN if you can. If you must use SPAN, make sure that the probe captures traffic for a central DHCP server. This capture can be problematic for some high availability solutions.

# HTTP and DHCP SPAN to Virtual ISE Appliances

If you need to use SPAN to collect HTTP or DHCP attributes, you should follow some best practices to ensure that you do not overload the PSN that is processing the data.

![[Pasted image 20230903182318.png]]

First, use VACL capture and redirect with Remote Switched Port Analyzer (RSPAN) to filter traffic to only interesting profile data. This usage also serves to reduce overall data that must be parsed by the PSN.

If your deployment is on a virtual appliance, be sure to dedicate a separate Cisco ISE interface for SPAN and then enable the interface from the CLI and assign it an IP address. Probes are supported on all interfaces. On the virtual machine appliance, you must enable promiscuous mode on the virtual switch or interface, otherwise, the SPAN and mirror traffic will not be accepted.

# SNMP and NetFlow Probes

Remember that while you typically are using profiling to identify endpoints that are authenticating to your network, profiling can identify any device, regardless of whether the device is authenticated or is just attached to the network. In some situations, using SNMPQUERY or NetFlow probes might be beneficial to identify rogue devices and determine what these rogue devices are.

![[Pasted image 20230903182330.png]]

While the information that is provided by the SNMP and NetFlow probes can be beneficial in certain situations, there are other security tools that might provide the same information without creating overhead on your PSN.

First, understand that triggered RADIUS accounting updates can increase SNMP overhead. This overhead is due to frequent re-authentications that can be caused by the following:

- Setting your session and reauthentication timers too low
- Frequent interim accounting updates
    
For polled SNMP queries, avoid short polling intervals and avoid using SNMP traps with RADIUS. This usage can increase network impact.

Also, you should only enable the NetFlow probe for specific use cases in centralized deployments. If you must use this probe, it is a best practice to use NetFlow v9 or higher because previous versions do not support all information that is likely required.

# Minimize Overhead

You should avoid using multiple probes that collect the same endpoint attributes. For example, some users may be tempted to enable every probe and configure helper addresses to forward DHCP requests to Cisco ISE. In this case, you would have the Device Sensor feature, SNMP Query, and IP helpers all forwarding similar, redundant information to Cisco ISE.

Instead, you should adopt a more methodical approach and enable only the probes that are necessary for your deployment.

![[Pasted image 20230903182343.png]]

You should also enable the Endpoint Attribute Filter. This filter reduces data collection and replication to a subset of profile-specific attributes, so that anything that is not used for profiling policy will not be replicated. By default, ISE collects a few dozen attributes, but many of them are never used. Enabling this feature ensures that you do not waste resources replicating irrelevant data.

If you enable Anomalous Behavior detection, Cisco ISE probes for data, and checks for any contradiction to the existing data with respect to changes in attributes related to NAS-Port-Type, DHCP Class Identifier, and Endpoint Policy. If so, an attribute called AnomalousBehavior set to true is added to the endpoint which helps you to filter and view the endpoints in the Visibility Context page. Audit logs are also generated for the respective MAC address.

If you enable Anomalous Behavior Enforcement, a CoA is issued upon detection of the anomalous Behavior, which can be used to re-authorize the suspicious endpoints, based on the authorization rules configured in the Profiler Configuration window.

![[Pasted image 20230903182356.png]]

Since the Device Sensor is the most efficient method of acquiring attributes, it is recommended to capture any sensor-provided attributes that are needed from it first. Enabling the Device Sensor feature on Cisco switches and wireless controllers significantly improves data collection optimization.

You should also ensure that profile data for a given endpoint is sent to a single PSN or perhaps a maximum of two PSNs. For example, if you enable SNMP traps, do not send these traps to multiple nodes because they not only receive redundant data, but they also replicate that redundant data. This replication results in needless overhead.

If you need attribute-collection redundancy, use load-balancers and Anycast (a virtual IP address (VIP). With this method, you use a single IP target for RADIUS or profiling that uses DHCP IP helpers, SNMP traps, and DHCP and HTTP.

# Node Groups

When two or more Policy Service Nodes (PSNs) are connected in an ISE deployment, it is recommended that they be placed in a node group. This design optimizes the replication of endpoint profiling data by retaining less significant attributes local to the group and reducing the information that is replicated to the remote nodes in the network.

![[Pasted image 20230903182406.png]]

Without node groups, data from all Monitoring nodes (MnTs), PSNs, and the secondary admin node are sent to the primary admin Policy Administration Node (PAN).

In a large deployment, you might have a collection of PSNs, in the Asia Pacific region, for example, that mostly need to talk to each other. You can create a node group for these PSNs to reduce network overhead and increase efficiency.

# IoT Devices and MUD

Internet of Things (IoT) devices can prove to be difficult to profile, and thus it is hard to enforce authorization policies for access to network resources. Luckily many of these devices use a standards-based process to help identify what the IoT devices capabilities are, allowing an administrator to match the correct network access policies.

![[Pasted image 20230903182419.png]]

Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) is an embedded software standard defined by the IETF that allows IoT device makers to advertise device specifications, including the intended communication patterns when their devices connected to the network. The network can then use this intent to author a context-specific access policy, so a device functions only within certain parameters. In turn, MUD becomes the authoritative identifier and enforcer of policy for devices on the network.

As shown in the figure, the following steps depict how MUD is used to enforce policy:

1. When an IoT device first connects to the network, it sends a MUD URL to a network access point embedded in either the LLDP, DHCP, or 802.1X request.
    
2. The network access device, which for Cisco deployments is restricted to Catalyst switches for now, extracts the URL, encapsulates it in a RADIUS packet, and sends it to the AAA server which is hosted on the ISE appliance. Note that some networks may instead forward the entire DHCP packet to the AAA server.
    
3. The AAA server then passes this URL to the MUD Controller, which is also hosted on the ISE appliance.
    
4. The MUD Controller then contacts the Internet-hosted MUD file server of the manufacturer that the URL references via HTTPS.
    
5. After verifying that the MUD file was produced by the device manufacturer, the MUD file corresponding to that device is sent to the MUD Controller. This file, which is a YANG Data Model represented as a JSON object, contains abstracted communication intent for the IoT device.
    
6. The MUD Controller translates this abstract intent to a context-specific policy, which is passed to the AAA server.
    
7. ISE then enforces the policy onto the network in the form of port-based Access Control Lists (ACLs) where the IoT device is connected.
    
8. Based on the manufacturer stated intent, access to the device is then provided.
