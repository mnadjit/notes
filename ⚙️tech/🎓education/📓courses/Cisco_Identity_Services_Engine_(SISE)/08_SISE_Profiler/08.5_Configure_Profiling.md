# Overview
In this lab, you will configure and verify the Cisco ISE profiling service. Specifically, you will verify that the profiler service is enabled and start the profiler feed service to keep endpoint profiling policies up to date. You will also configure the NAD definitions for SNMP polling and the global SNMP Profiler settings. Lastly, you will verify the NAD configurations for profiling operations.

# Configure Cisco ISE Profiling
In this task, you will verify that the Cisco ISE profiler service is enabled and configure its parameters.

**Verify Endpoint Data**

To configure profiling in Cisco ISE, access the Cisco ISE Work Centers to view the necessary steps to prepare, define, and monitor your profiler service configuration.

### Step 1

From the Admin-PC, open the Firefox browser and access the Cisco ISE admin portal at **https://ise-1.abc.public** with the username **admin** and password **1234QWer**.

### Step 2

Navigate to **Work Centers > Profiler > Overview** to view the required configuration steps that are necessary to enable and configure the profiler service.

The Profiler Overview lists many of the steps needed to prepare Cisco ISE for the profiler service, defines how ISE will use profiling data, and specifies what the administrator should do to monitor profiling data once the profiler service is live.

The profiler service may already be enabled, but even without the profiler service enabled, Cisco ISE can collect endpoint attributes without probes. In the next few steps, you will determine which devices that Cisco ISE has already identified.

### Step 3

From the **Work Centers > Profiler > Overview** portal, choose the **Endpoint Classification** tab.

You can also reach this page via the **Context Visibility > Endpoints > Endpoint Classification** menu option.

### Step 4

Observe the endpoint data that has already populated the endpoint database.

While troubleshooting a live environment, a useful way to find endpoints is to perform a quick filter by clicking the gear icon on the far right and filter by OUI or OS type as shown.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Modular/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Verify-Endpoint-Data_002.png)

### Step 5

Select the check box next to one of the windows workstation endpoints, then click the blue hyperlink of the MAC address or Username to view information about the endpoint.

### Step 6

Click on the **Attributes** tab. Then click the **Other Attributes** section to observe the attribute list data.

The attributes are listed alphabetically and can be used later to customize the profiler conditions and policies.

- The endpoint policy is the endpoint profile that is applied.
    
- The endpoint source is the probe or service that initially provided the attribute data that was used to profile the endpoint.
    
- The identity group is the group the MAC address was added to after the profiling policy was matched.
    

Scroll through the collected attributes so see what ISE has collected for the endpoint. The EndPointPolicy, EndPointSource, and IdentityGroup can be helpful in understanding how ISE determined what the endpoint capabilities are.

## Note

Depending on which Windows workstation you are observing, the Endpoint Source could be any of the guest portals. If the Endpoint Source is a guest portal, it is an indicator that the HTTP request to the portal was mapped back to the MAC address of this endpoint, and the HTTP header information from that request was used for profiling.

**Verify the Profiling Service**

### Step 7

Navigate back to **Work Centers > Profiler > Overview**.

### Step 8

Under the **Prepare** column and in the **Profiling Configuration** section, click the **Deployment** link to verify that the profiling service is enabled.

If a pop-up appears informing you that the deployment is in Stand-Alone mode, click **OK**.

This page can also be reached via **Administration > System > Deployment**.

### Step 9

In the right pane, select your Cisco ISE node to edit it.

### Step 10

To verify that the profiling service is enabled, under the Policy Service section, make sure the **Enable Profiling Service** check box is checked.

### Step 11

Select the **Profiling Configuration** tab.

### Step 12

Observe the Cisco ISE version 3.1-specific probes that are enabled by default.

The probes that are enabled by default include the following:

- DHCP
    
- RADIUS
    
- Network Scan (Nmap)
    
- SNMPQUERY
    
- Active Directory
    

## Configure the Feed Service

With the profiler feed service, you can retrieve new and updated endpoint profiling policies. The updated OUI database is a feed from a designated Cisco feed server through a subscription from Cisco ISE.

In this task, you will enable and configure notification settings for the Cisco ISE profiler feed service. You will also force a manual update.

### Step 13

In the Cisco ISE Admin portal, navigate to **Work Centers > Profiler > Feeds**.

You can also reach this page via **Administration > Feed Service > Profiler**.

### Step 14

If necessary, check the **Enable Online Subscription Update** check box.

### Step 15

Check the **Notify administrator when download occurs** check box and enter the email address **admin@abc.public**.

Email notification requires that the SMTP server is configured on Cisco ISE. You can perform this action via the **Administration > Settings > SMTP Server** page. This task has been preconfigured for you in this lab.

## Note

When initially configuring the feed service, it is a good idea to test the feed service connection. This test result should be successful, as shown in the screenshot.

### Step 16

Scroll down and click **Save**. Then click the **Update Now** button.

### Step 17

Click **Yes** on the pop-up Warning window.

### Step 18

Notice the Server Response message in the lower right corner that indicates that the feed service successfully started.

## Note

The update process will take some time, at least 30-45 minutes. In production, you can verify the feed service operations via the email that you define, or by scrolling to the bottom of the page and viewing the Latest Update section.

### Step 19

Do not wait for the update process to finish. Continue to the next task.

## Configure the NAD for Profiling

In this task, you will modify the NAD definition configuration for profiling in Cisco ISE.

### Step 20

Navigate to **Work Centers > Profiler > Network Devices**.

You can also reach this page via **Administration > Network Resources > Network Devices**.

### Step 21

Click the **3k-access** switch to edit the NAD profile and configure the following settings:

|Attribute|Value|
|---|---|
|SNMP Settings|Enabled|
|SNMP Version|2c|
|SNMP RO Community|ciscoro|
|Polling Interval|600|
|Link Trap Query|Disabled|
|MAC Trap Query|Disabled|

## Note

Notice that at the bottom of the dialog box, the Originating Policy Service Node is set to Auto. While not mandatory in the lab with a single Cisco ISE node, it is a best practice to set the Originating Policy Service Node for SNMP profiling operations to the node closest to the NAD. This setting is especially true in a larger or geographically dispersed Cisco ISE deployment.

### Step 22

Scroll down and click **Save**.

### Step 23

Return to the list of Network Devices.

### Step 24

Modify the NAD definition configuration of your podâ€™s 9800 WLC with the same values that you assigned the 3k-access switch.

**Modify the Profiler Configuration**

### Step 25

Navigate to **Work Center > Profiler > Settings** and in the left pane, select **Profiler Settings**.

You can also reach this page via **Administration > System > Settings > Profiling**.

### Step 26

Modify the Profiler Configuration according to the following table:

|Attribute|Value|
|---|---|
|CoA Type|Reauth|
|Change custom SNMP community strings|ciscorw|
|Confirm change custom SNMP community strings|ciscorw|
|EndPoint Attribute Filter|Disabled|
|Anomalous Behavior Detection|Disabled|
|Anomalous Behavior Enforcement|Disabled|
|Custom Attribute for Profiling Enforcement|Disabled|
|Profiling for MUD|Disabled|
|Profiler Forwarder Persistence Queue|Enabled|
|XSS Security Scan Enforcement for EndPoint Probe Data|Disabled|

### Step 27

Click **Save** to save your configuration.

**Verify Profiler Exception Action**

### Step 28

Navigate to **Work Centers > Profiler > Policy Elements** and in the left pane, select **Exception Actions**.

You can also reach this page via **Policy > Policy Elements > Results > Profiling > Exception Actions**.

### Step 29

Click **First Time Profile** to view the action details. Notice that the CoA Action is to Force COA.

This action occurs when an endpoint profile that is Unknown is profiled for the first time.

## Note

This is the default action for all the Cisco-provided exception actions.

## Verify the NAD Configuration for Profiling

In this task, you will verify the profiling configuration on your pod WLC and 3k-access switch. Your pod NADs are already preconfigured for you.

### Step 30

Open a new tab in a browser on your Admin-PC. Access your 9800 WLC at [https://10.10.10.50](https://10.10.10.50).

### Step 31

Add a security exception for the certificate error and log in with the credentials of username **Admin** and password **1234QWer**.

### Step 32

Navigate to **Administration > Management > SNMP**.

### Step 33

Click the SNMP Mode toggle button that reads Disabled to change it to Enabled.

### Step 34

Click the **Community Strings** tab, and then click the **Add** button.

### Step 35

Add the community **ciscoro** with the **Read Only** access mode.

### Step 36

Repeat this process to add the community **ciscorw** with the **Read/Write** access mode.

### Step 37

Verify the configuration matches the following screen shot.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Modular/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Verify-the-NAD-Configuration_001.png)

### Step 38

Close the browser tab for the 9800WLC.

### Step 39

Open PuTTy from the Admin-PC desktop, connect to the switch with the saved switch profile, and log in with the username **admin** and the password **1234QWer**.

### Step 40

Run the following commands to view the preconfigured SNMP and MAC configurations:

`show run | include snmp-server`

`show run | include mac`

### Step 41

Run the following commands to view the preconfigured ip helper-address configuration for the employee VLAN 30 and guest VLAN 40.

These VLANs send DHCP packets to both the DHCP and the Cisco ISE node.

`show run interface VLAN 30`

`show run interface VLAN 40`

### Step 42

Close your console session.

## Conclusion

After you have verified that your Profiler Service is enabled, that the correct probes are enabled in Cisco ISE, and that your Network Access Devices are configured to send endpoint and device attributes to Cisco ISE (via RADIUS with Device Sensor and SNMP) you have completed the Profiler configuration of Cisco ISE.
