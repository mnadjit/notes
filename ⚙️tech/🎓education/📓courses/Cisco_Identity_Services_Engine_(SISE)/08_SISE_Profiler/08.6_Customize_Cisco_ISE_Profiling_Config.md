# Overview
In this lab, you will configure the Cisco ISE profiler service to use profiling data to make policy determinations. You will examine profiled endpoint data, create a logical profile, and use that profile as an identity condition for authorization policy. Finally, you will create a custom profiler policy that is based on observed endpoint data.

# Pre-Lab Activity
Determine the name of the pod that you are using.

### Step 1

From the Admin-PC, open PuTTY and connect to the pod switch (10.10.10.3).

### Step 2

Log into the switch with the username **admin** and the password **1234QWer**.

### Step 3

Note the hostname listed at the prompt. The last two fields of the hostname indicate the pod that you are using. The example is taken from pod “PG00-P01.”

Remember your pod number, you will need it for testing.

## Examine Endpoint Data

In this task, you will examine the endpoint data that has been collected since you enabled Cisco ISE profiling.

### Step 4

From your Admin-PC, open a Firefox browser and access the Cisco ISE Admin portal at **https://ise-1.abc.public** with the username **admin** and the password **1234QWer**.

### Step 5

Navigate to **Context Visibility** > **Endpoints** and then choose the **Endpoint Classification** tab.

### Step 6

Change the Rows/Page option to 25 and observe the list of endpoints that have been learned since enabling the SNMP query probe with the switch and WLC.

If you have more than one page to view, use the arrows in the upper-right near the Rows, Page column to view more pages. Also, you can sort on a heading in either ascending or descending order.

### Step 7

In the quick-filter field of the IP Address column, type the IP address of the WLC, **10.10.10.50**, and press **Enter**.

By default, the endpoint classification table lists every endpoint that Cisco ISE has seen, and in a production environment, this could be thousands of endpoints. Making use of the quick-filters at the top of the table will make finding endpoints in the table much easier.

### Step 8

From the table, click on the blue hyperlink of the WLC’s MAC address.

### Step 9

Click the **Attributes** tab and note how Cisco ISE has profiled the WLC in the General Attributes section.

The endpoint profile reflects the endpoint policy that was matched by the profiler service. Your WLC matches the profile Cisco-Router as it is a Layer 3 Cisco IOS device.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Modular/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Examine-Endpoint-Data_003.png)

### Step 10

Click on the **Other Attributes** tab and scroll through the data that has been collected for the WLC.

Even though the WLC did not authenticate to the network, Cisco ISE is collecting attributes for the endpoint.

### Step 11

Observe that the **EndPointPolicy** and **EndPointSource** informs you of the endpoint profile that was applied to the WLC and the initial source of that policy decision.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Modular/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Examine-Endpoint-Data_004.png)

### Step 12

Scroll down through the list and observe the attributes that Cisco ISE has collected about the WLC. Observe that the SNMP query probe was able to pull Cisco Discovery Protocol information about the endpoint and added that information to the list.

If this WLC needed to be profiled to a specific endpoint policy or identity group, you could build a profiler policy with conditions that match any of the data in this list.

## Profile Your Pod Client-PC

**On the Admin-PC**

### Step 13

From the ISE admin GUI, navigate to **Context Visibility** > **Endpoints** and then choose the **Endpoint** **Classification** tab.

### Step 14

Remove any filters from the endpoint classification table that are applied by clicking the “X” next to the filter in the Filters section

### Step 15

In the quick-filter field of the IP Address column, enter the IP address of your Client-PC on the guest network, **10.10.40.100**.

### Step 16

Select all the endpoint MAC addresses that have used that IP address by checking their corresponding check boxes and delete them from the database. If asked, confirm the deletion.

### Step 17

Remove any filters that are applied by clicking the “X” next to the filter.

**On the Client-PC**

### Step 18

Access your Client-PC and login with the username **Student** and password **1234QWer**

### Step 19

Click on the wireless icon in the Windows taskbar and scroll though the list of WLANs until you find the guest WLAN for your pod.

The WLAN name will use the pod name you discovered in the pre-lab activity followed by the word “Guest” (PGxx-Pxx-Guest). For example, the WLAN for pod PG00-P02 is “PG00-P02-Guest”.

## Note

(If the wireless icon is missing from the taskbar enter “wifi” into the windows search bar and select “Change Wi-fi Settings”. From that window select “Show Available Networks”.)

### Step 20

Click on your guest network from the list of WLANs to expand the connection options, leave the **Connect automatically** checkbox unselected, and click **Connect**.

It may take a few seconds for the connection to establish.

### Step 21

Open a new Firefox web browser and load a new webpage, such as **http://www.cisco.com**, to check your connection.

### Step 22

When redirected to the sponsored guest portal page, log in with the username **employee1@abc.public** and the password **1234QWer**. (You will need to scroll down to accept the terms of use.)

A successful login should redirect you to the Cisco ISE product page at the cisco.com website.

### Step 23

From the Search field in the Windows taskbar, type **Network Connections** and then click **View network connections**.

### Step 24

Right-click the **Wi-Fi** NIC and choose **Status**.

### Step 25

Click the **Details** button and verify that your wireless Client-PC has an IP address in the 10.10.40.x network.

### Step 26

Record the physical Address (MAC Address) and the IP address of your wireless Client-PC. (Yours may be different from the example.)

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Modular/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Profile-Your-Pod-Client-PC_005.png)

### Step 27

Close all open dialog boxes.

**On the Admin-PC**

### Step 28

Return to your Admin-PC, and from the ISE Admin portal, navigate to **Context Visibility** > **Endpoints** > **Endpoint Classification**.

### Step 29

Remove any applied filters by clicking the “X” next to them in the Filters section and click the Refresh button on the left side just above the endpoint data information section.

### Step 30

In the quick-filter field of the MAC address column, enter the MAC address you just recorded for your wireless Client_PC.

## Note

Use colons instead of dashes between fields; a partial MAC address may be enough to find yours.

Alternately you could enter the IP address of the device, but in a DHCP environment, the IP address may have been used for multiple endpoints. Filtering by MAC address should only list a single endpoint in your environment.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Modular/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Profile-Your-Pod-Client-PC_006.png)

### Step 31

Click on the hyperlink of the wireless Client-PC endpoint profile.

### Step 32

Click **Attributes**, and in the General Attributes section, notice that Cisco ISE has determined an endpoint policy of **Windows10-Workstation** and that the MAC address has been added to the **GuestEndpoint** identity group.

Profiling has determined the applied endpoint policy, and successfully authenticating to the sponsored guest portal set the endpoint into the identity group.

### Step 33

To view how the profiler determined the endpoint policy, click the **Other Attributes** tab, and scroll down to the **EndPointPolicy** and **EndPointSource**. The EndPointPolicy is based on the profiler policy that was matched, and the EndPointSource is the **_first_** probe that was able to provide an attribute to match the endpoint policy.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Modular/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Profile-Your-Pod-Client-PC_008.png)

In the example shown, notice that the SNMP probe was the first probe that provided the match. However, in this lab, it is just as likely that you see the passive HTTP match from the Sponsored Guest Portal as the EndPointSource. Remember that there may be several sources of attributes that could provide a match for the profiler policy, and only the first one that makes the match will be shown.

## Edit a Logical Profile

In this task, you will edit a logical profile that you will use in a future authorization policy.

### Step 34

In the Cisco ISE Admin portal, navigate to **Work Centers** > **Profiler** > **Profiling Policies** and in the left pane select **Logical Profiles**.

### Step 35

In the right pane, click the blue hyperlink for the **Printers** logical profile.

### Step 36

In the Available Policies column on the left, select the **HP-Device** policy and click the “**>**” button to add it to the Assigned Policies column on the right.

## Note

To find the policy faster, highlight anything in the list and type the letter “H” to jump to the part of the list with entries that start with the letter “H”.

### Step 37

Click **Save** and wait for the **Server Response** message.

## Create a New Authorization Policy with a Logical Profile

In this task, you will create an authorization policy that assigns the previously configured logical profile to a fixed authorization profile.

### Step 38

In the Cisco ISE Admin portal, navigate to **Work Centers** > **Profiler** > **Policy Sets** > **Wired Access Policy**.

### Step 39

Expand the **Authorization Policy** section and disable the **Printer Authorization** rule by clicking its green checkmark icon and selecting **Disabled**.

### Step 40

At the top of the list, insert a new policy with the following parameters:

- **Rule Name:** Logical Printers
    
    1. **Permissions:** Guest Access
        
    2. **Conditions:** Endpoints: LogicalProfile (under the UNCLASSIFIED icon) Equals Printers
        
    3. **Profile:** Printers
        

### Step 41

Click **Use**, and verify the configuration matches the following example:

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Modular/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Create-a-New-Authorization-Policy_002.png)

### Step 42

Scroll down and click **Save**.

## Create a Custom Profile Policy

In this task, you will create a custom profile policy for your pod’s wireless access point.

### Step 43

In the Cisco ISE Admin portal, navigate to **Work Centers** > **Profiler** > **Endpoint Classification**.

### Step 44

To find an access point for your pod, type **Cisco-AP** in the Endpoint Profile column quick-filter field and press **Enter**.

You may see one or two access points listed.

### Step 45

Click on the blue hyperlink of either of the APs listed.

### Step 46

Navigate to **Attributes** > **Other Attributes** and notice that the AP has already matched an endpoint policy with a certainty factor of 75, identifying the platform and OS version.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Modular/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Create-a-Custom-Profile_002.png)

When creating a custom policy, you can look at the information in the Other Attributes tab to determine if Cisco ISE is collecting attributes that can be used to create a custom profiler policy.

There are attribute types for all the probes that Cisco ISE uses, and different attributes are available for each of the probes.

In this lab, both the RADIUS probe (with device sensor) and the SNMP query probe are providing Cisco Discovery Protocol attributes that we will use to create a custom policy.

### Step 47

Close the Edit Endpoint window and navigate to **Work Centers** > **Profiler** > **Policy Elements**.

### Step 48

Click the funnel icon in the upper-right corner of the table to open the quick-filters at the top of the columns.

### Step 49

In the Expression column quick-filter field, enter **C9115**.

“C9115” is from the cdpCachePlatform attribute that was seen in a previous step.

### Step 50

Click the blue hyperlink of the Condition named **Cisco-AP-Catalyst-9115AX-Rule1-Check1** to see how the condition is configured. Notice that the type of attribute is **Cisco Discovery Protocol**, the attribute name is **cdpCachePlatform**, and the operator is **contains**.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Modular/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Create-a-Custom-Profile_003.png)

Conditions can be built for most attributes that Cisco ISE is able to collect for endpoints on the network. You will use this previously created profiler condition shown here to configure a new profiler policy with a higher certainty factor than the policy that is currently used.

### Step 51

Navigate to **Work Centers** > **Profiler** > **Profiling Policies** and click the **Add** button at the top of the table.

### Step 52

Create a profiler policy with the following parameters:

Cisco Custom_AP_Profiler_Policy
|Attribute|Value|
|---|---|
|Name|Custom_AP_Profiler_Policy|
|Description|Profile Catalyst AP|
|Minimum Certainty Factor|100|
|Create an Identity Group for the Policy|Yes, create a matching Identity Group|
|Parent Policy|Cisco-Device|
|Condition|Select Existing Condition from Library > Cisco-AP-Catalyst_9115AX-Rule1-Check1 (It will take several seconds for the list to populate. When it does enter 9115 in the search field to find the condition faster)|
|Certain factor increase value|100|

### Step 53

Verify your configuration matches the following example and click **Submit**.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Modular/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Create-a-Custom-Profile_004.png)

### Step 54

Return to **Work Centers** > **Profiler** > **Endpoint Classification**

Alternatively, you can navigate to **Context Visibility** > **Endpoints**.

### Step 55

In the Endpoint Classification table, note the endpoint that has been assigned the **Cisco Custom_AP_Profiler_Policy** endpoint profile.

## Note

Type the word **Custom** in the Endpoint Profile column quick-filter field to filter the table.

It may be necessary to click the Refresh button in the upper-right of the list. Depending on the SNMP Polling time interval, it can take up to 5 minutes for the endpoint change to appear.

### Step 56

Click on the blue hyperlink of the endpoint with the Custom_AP_Profiler_Policy endpoint profile.

### Step 57

Click the **Attributes** tab and observe that the IdentityGroup has been set to Custom_AP_Profiler_Policy, and that the endpoint has been placed into the Custom_AP_Profiler_Policy identity group that was automatically created with the policy.

You can now use this identity group in authorization policies to assign specific authorization profiles if you desire.

## Note

Due to time constraints, you will not create an authorization policy using the identity group. The process would be similar to creating a policy using a logical profile. However, instead of creating a condition, you would use identity groups and select the Custom_AP_Profiler_Policy identity group.

## Test Authorization Policies with Profiling Data

In this task, you will force the printer to authenticate and use the logical profile, Printers, to match the correct authorization policy.

### Step 58

On the Admin-PC desktop, open PuTTY, connect to the switch and log in with the username **admin** and the password **1234QWer**.

### Step 59

Clear the current authentication on interface GigabitEthernet1/0/3 by disabling and then re-enabling the interface. Use the following commands:

C3560-CX-PGxx-Pxx#**configure terminal**
C3560-CX-PGxx-Pxx(config)#**interface GigabitEthernet1/0/3**
C3560-CX-PGxx-Pxx(config-if)#**shutdown**
C3560-CX-PGxx-Pxx(config-if)#**no shutdown**

### Step 60

From the ISE admin GUI, navigate to **Operations** > **RADIUS** > **Live Logs**.

### Step 61

To find the entry for the printer, type **HP-Device** in the Endpoint Profile column quick-filter field.

### Step 62

Click on the magnifying glass icon to open a details page for the printer.

### Step 63

In the Overview section of the details page, verify that the printer matched the new authorization policy called **Logical Printers**.

### Step 64

Scrolling down to the bottom of the Other Attributes section, you can see the logical profile that was applied is Printers.

### Step 65

In the Results section, below the Other Attributes section, you can see that this profiled authorization consumed one ISE Advantage license.

### Step 66

Navigate to **Work Centers** > **Profiler** > **Profiling Policies** > **Logical Profiles** > **Printers**.

### Step 67

Scroll down to the table at the bottom of the window and notice that your printer has been assigned to the correct logical profile.
