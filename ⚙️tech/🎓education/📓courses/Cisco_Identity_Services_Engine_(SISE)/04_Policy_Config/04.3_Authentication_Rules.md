Once a RADIUS request has matched a Cisco ISE Policy Set, it needs to go through an authentication process. This training introduces Cisco ISE authentication policy rules and their components.



# Cisco ISE Authentication Process

After a RADIUS request is matched to a Policy Set, it is compared to the Policy Set rules in a top-down order. The first set of policies that are compared are the authentication policies.

The preceding figure shows the relationship among various Cisco ISE services that are related to authentication, authorization, posture, profiling, and guest. This topic is focused on authentication.

Authentication requests are processed immediately after an endpoint attempts to access the network through the Network Access Device (NAD). Cisco ISE evaluates contextual information that is related to the endpoint’s connection and compares it against the authentication policy conditions. When it finds a match, a particular external or internal ID store is selected, or a sequence of stores are chosen. The user’s credentials are checked against the identity store. Of course, when invalid credentials result in a failed authentication, access is typically denied. Valid credentials result in a successful authentication.

After authentication, the authorization policy is processed, along with the other services shown in the figure.

# Authentication Policy Components

The Policy Set defines the protocols that Cisco ISE uses to authenticate devices. The authentication policy defines the identity sources that it should use for authentication.

The authentication policy is made up of a list of rules. Each authentication rule has three components:

- Name
    
- Set of conditions – simple or compound
    
- Use (Resulting identity source) – Single source or Identity Source Sequence
    

The authentication policy name is any arbitrary name that makes sense to you, perhaps matching some corporate naming convention.

A condition consists of an operand (attribute), an operator (equal to, not equal to, greater than, and so on), and a value. You can create compound conditions that are composed of one or more simple conditions that are connected by the AND or OR operator. Cisco ISE evaluates the policy condition and then applies the specified result, based on whether the policy evaluation returns a true or a false value.

Cisco ISE allows you to create conditions as individual, reusable policy elements that can be pulled from other rule-based policies. To save a condition for reuse in another policy, click the save button when defining the condition, give it a name, and the condition will be added to the library of the Condition Editor.

The identity source can be a single database, such as the internal endpoints, or it can be an Identity Source Sequence. An Identity Source Sequence defines a list of identity databases and in what order they should be checked.

The figure shows a simple rule named **MAB_Rule**. The condition uses the form of a Boolean, operator, and a result. The condition states: **IF Normalized Radius-RadiusFlowType = WiredMAB**. If this Boolean (**Normalized Radius-RadiusFlowType**), operator (=) and result (**WiredMAB**) are met, the Cisco ISE internal endpoint database will be used to search for credentials.

There is a second rule named **TLS_Rule**. This rule strings together two conditions. If the condition **Network Access-EAPAuthentication = EAP-TLS**, AND the condition **CERTIFICATE-Issuer = ad.abc.public** are both met, then the specific Active Directory server abc.public will be checked for credentials. If you know which server issued the certificate, as in the example, you are able to verify the credentials against that specific server instead of trying a list of servers. This implementation can reduce the time needed for the lookup process.

The word **CERTIFICATE** is the dictionary. Inside that dictionary are a list of certificate-related attributes. In this example, **Issuer** is the attribute.

# Dictionaries

Dictionaries provide fundamental building blocks for Cisco ISE policies. They contain a collection of parameters that define session attributes. These attributes are referenced in conditions, which define policy applicability. Conditions are used to build authentication and authorization policies. Conditions specify constraints on session attributes, which are used to define which policies apply in real-time.

Dictionaries allow for the administrator to create condition matches for almost any piece of data included in a RADIUS or TACACS+ request. This allows for authentication rules to be as specific as needed for the policy that is being applied. These dictionaries are also able to be used when defining conditions in Policy Sets and authorization policies.

Cisco ISE includes a list of built-in, system dictionaries. The preceding figure shows the use of the system dictionary CERTIFICATE and highlights the condition that was defined in an earlier example to match the certificate issuer. You can explore these dictionaries from the admin portal by navigating from the main menu to: **Policy > Policy Elements > Dictionaries**.

# Identity Sources

Cisco ISE can use its own internal identity databases, as well as integrating with external identity sources to validate user credentials during authentication. The Policy Service Node (PSN) that is handling the RADIUS or TACACS+ request will query the configured external identity source or query a local copy of the internal database if used.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Monolithic/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Identity-Sources_001.png)

Identity sources are also used to retrieve group information and other user attributes for authorization. Cisco ISE supports several commonly implemented identity sources, including Active Directory and LDAP. External identity sources also include certificate information for the Cisco ISE server and certificate authentication profiles. If using the local Certificate Authority (CA) in Cisco ISE, you can reference it as an identity source.

The preceding figure shows a rule referencing an Identity Source Sequence. An Identity Source Sequence allows two or more identity sources to be referenced, and they will be queried in the order they are listed until the identity is verified, rejected, or determined to not exist.

The internal user database is the default source listed when creating an authentication rule and is populated by a Cisco ISE administrator. The internal endpoint database is primarily populated using the Cisco ISE profiler function.

# Authentication Configuration Overview

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Monolithic/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Authentication-Configuration-Overview_001.png)

The procedure to define a rule-based authentication policy on Cisco ISE is as follows:

1. Using an authentication policy in the default Policy Set, add a new rule.
    
2. Give the new rule a name, define or add conditions, and choose identity sources. You can also choose what action to take if the authentication fails, the user is not found, or the process fails.
    
3. (Situational) Tune the default rule. The default rule defines actions to be taken when no specific match is found.
    

In the example shown in the preceding figure, the Wired_MAB rule will use the internal endpoints database when it is matched. If the authentication fails, the connection attempt is rejected. If the user (in this case, the MAC address) is not found, Cisco ISE will continue to the authorization policies to see if a match can be made. And if the process fails, the RADIUS request will be dropped.

> Note

It is important to note that successfully being authenticated, or being allowed to continue to the authorization process, does not guarantee that the user or endpoint will be granted access. This only means that Cisco ISE will continue to process the request and match it against any authorization rules that are configured. The default authorization rule is to deny access, so a specific rule will need to be matched to achieve a successful authorization.

Keep in mind that the rules of a policy will be read from the top down. The first rule that is matched will be used. When creating a policy, have the rules with the more specific conditions at the top of the list. If you need to rearrange rules, you can drag them up or down the list as needed. The default rule is always at the bottom of the list and will be used if there are no matches made.
