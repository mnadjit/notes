Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) uses a hierarchical policy system to control network access. In this training, you will learn about policy sets—the top of the hierarchy—and how they steer users to the next hierarchical levels: authentication policy and authorization policy.

# Hierarchical Policy Control Access

Policy sets are at the top of the Cisco ISE policy control hierarchy. A policy set has three primary, interrelated functions:

- Serves as a container for a logical grouping of authentication and authorization policies
    
- Uses Boolean conditions to steer users to the appropriate group of policies for network authentication and authorization
    
- Limits the authorization session to a set of allowed protocols (or proxy to an external RADIUS server)
    

# Policy Set Hierarchy

Policy sets allow you to group authentication and authorization policies based on some criteria. For example, the grouping can be based on the following:

- **Use case:** You might group a set of authentication and authorization policies that are based on use case—wireless, wired, guest, or endpoint provisioning. In the preceding figure, wired users use a different set of policies than wireless users.
    
- **Location:** You also could create different policy sets for different locations in your organization—region, campus, or building. You might want users in the main campus to authenticate by using different resources than those in a remote campus. You can use any criteria appropriate for your organization.
    

To create a policy set, you configure three main items: a name, conditions, and a resultant set of allowed protocols. In the example shown in the figure, if users attempt to access the network via a wired Ethernet switch, then PolSet1 is selected. Users will be limited to a set of allowed protocols for authentication. In this case, they are allowed to use only MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) or Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS). They will be authenticated based on the rules contained in AuthC_Policy1 and authorized to access certain resources via the authorization policy named AuthZ_Policy1.

Policy sets are processed from the top down, very much like a typical access list. Because PolSet1 is listed first, its conditions are checked first. If those conditions are not met (not a wired user), then PolSet2 is checked.

The PolSet2 condition checks if users are using wireless devices. If so, then users may only authenticate via Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) or EAP-TLS. They are authenticated by the AuthC_Policy2 rules and authorized based on the rules in AuthZ_Policy2.

# Policy Set Application

Policy set configuration is part of each Cisco ISE work center. You do not need to move back to the Policy configuration section in the Cisco ISE main menu for each policy set. While the function that you are configuring in each work center differs, the processing of RADIUS requests is handled the same way.

Policy sets are a critical component of many Cisco ISE functions, including the following:

- Network access
    
- Guest access
    
- TrustSec
    
- BYOD
    
- Profiler
    
- Posture
    
- Device administration (TACACS+ rules)
    

# Policy Set Configuration

You create policy sets with a name, conditions, and the resulting allowed protocols. You can optionally provide a description.

Each policy set contains its own authentication and authorization rules, which cannot be shared among nor copied between policy sets. However, you can define rule conditions, save them to the condition library, and reuse these saved conditions.

For simpler deployments, you may only need the default policy set. More involved deployments may require separate policy sets for separate use cases, locations, or other criteria as required by your particular organization.

As shown in the preceding figure, two policy sets have been created in addition to the default. The top policy set, named Wired Access Policy, matches on the condition **DEVICE-Device Type EQUALS All Device Types#Wired** and uses the default allowed protocols list. The second policy set, named Wireless Access Policy, matches on the condition **DEVICE-Device Type EQUALS All Device Types#Wireless** and also uses the default allowed protocols list. If the RADIUS request does not match either of the two added policy sets, the default policy set is used.

# Allowed Protocols

Each policy set has an attached allowed protocols list that defines which authentication methods can be used with the policy set. You can adjust the strength of the authentication method being used based on the conditions that match the policy set.

For example, network access could require EAP, parts of your network that need more stringent access methods might require the use of PEAP, and areas of the network where IP phones, printers, camera, guests, and other devices that might not be using an 802.1X supplicant could authenticate with MAB.

Attached to the default policy set, Cisco ISE has a default allowed protocol list that supports the majority of secure authentication methods as well as MAB. You can use this allowed protocol list for any policy sets that you create, or you can create custom allowed protocol lists based on the security needs of your deployment.

# Authentication and Authorization Policies

The second level of the Cisco ISE policy system hierarchy is composed of the actual policies for authentication and for authorization.

Authentication policies control which identity source or identity source sequence to check for user credentials. Each policy set can have only one authentication policy, but that policy can have multiple rules.

![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/cisco-cte/sise40/assets/Security/Monolithic/SISE/v4.0/Graphics/SISE_4-0-0_Authentication_and_Authorization_Policies_001.png)

In the preceding figure, the authentication policy named PolSet1 has two rules, and, like policy sets, these rules are processed from the top down. Based on the first rule, if the endpoint attempts to authenticate via MAB, then its credentials are checked against a single identity source—the Cisco ISE Internal Endpoint database. If this condition is not met, then the second rule is checked. If using 802.1X, then an identity source sequence is applied. First, the Active Directory named AD_1 is checked, and then the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) database named LDAP_1 is checked.

Whether MAB or 802.1X is used, user credentials are checked against the appropriate database. If credentials are valid, the user is authenticated—you know who the user is. But what actions will you let the user perform?

The authorization policy controls the resources that a user can access. Again, you can have only one authorization policy (and some authorization exception policies). This policy can have several rules that are all processed from the top down.

In the authorization policy PolSet1, access levels are determined by the Active Directory group membership. If you are a member of the Employees group, then you are given appropriate employee-level access. If you are a member of the Contractors group, then your rights are limited to only access a smaller set of resources.

To summarize, when a user attempts to access a network:

- Network access services are chosen at the policy set level.
    
- Identity sources are chosen at the authentication policy level.
    
- Network permissions are chosen at the authorization policy level.
