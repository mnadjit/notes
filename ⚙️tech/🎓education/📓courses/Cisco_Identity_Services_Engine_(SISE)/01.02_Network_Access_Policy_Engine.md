- Administrator access to network devices can be more securely managed using *TACACS+* rather than *RADIUS*. 
- *RADIUS* is generally used more for user network access control.
- The ability to do segmentation beyond the constraints of the traditional layer-2 and 3 segmentation greatly benefits not only network security, but it also helps simplify network design.
- *Cisco ISE* is a centralized network access control and policy enforcement platform.
- *Cisco ISE* gathers key information about users and devices attempting to connect to the network as well as administrators connecting to network device management consoles and uses that data to provide controlled access. The gathered information can also be used to ensure regulatory compliance to various government and industry standards or be shared with other Cisco ecosystem partner devices using *pxGrid* or APIs.
