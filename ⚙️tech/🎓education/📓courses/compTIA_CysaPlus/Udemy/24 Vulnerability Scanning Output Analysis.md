# Scan Reports

# Common Identifiers
## CVE
#cve #common_vulnerabilities_and_exposures
**Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures**
Developed by MITRE and adopted by NIST

## NVD
#nvd #national_vulnerability_database
**National Vulnerability Database**
Superset of CVE, and adds more info like CVSS

## CWE
#cwe #common_weakness_enumeration
**Common Weakness Enumeration**

## CAPEC
#capec #common_attack_pattern_enumeration_and_classification
**Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification**
Knowledge base maintained by MITRE focused on app sec and exploit techniques #appsec #app_sec

## CPE
#cpe #common_platform_enumeration
**Common Platform Enumeration**
- Hardware: Part *H*
- Operating Systems: Part *O*
- Applications: Part *A*
pattern:
```
cpe:/{part}:{vendor}:{product}:{version}:{update}:{edition}:{language}
```

## CCE
#cce #common_configuration_enumeration
**Common Configuration Enumeration**
Scheme for provisioning secure configuration checks across multiple sources
It's a collection of configuration best-practice statements

# CVSS
#cvss #common_vulnerability_scoring_system
**Common Vulnerability Scoring System**
a risk management approach to quantify vulnerability data and assign a number to vulnerabilities

| Score    | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| None     | 0           |
| Low      | 0.1 - 3.9   |
| Medium   | 4.0 - 6.9   |
| High     | 7.0 - 8.9   |
| Critical | 9.0 - 10.0  |

How the CVSS score is calculated?
- Base Metrics
- Temporal Metrics
- Environmental Metrics

## Base Metrics
| Component                | Description                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Access Vector (AV)       | Physical (P), Local (L), Adjacent Network (A), Network (N) |
| Access Complexity (AC)   | High (H), Low (L)                                          |
| Privileges Required (PR) | None (N), Low (L), High (H)                                |
| User Interactions (UI)   | None (N), Required (R)                                     |
| Scope (S)                | Unchanged (U), Changed (C)                                 |
| Confidentiality (C)      | High (H), Medium (M), Low (L)                              |
| Integrity (I)            | High (H), Medium (M), Low (L)                              |
| Availability (A)         | High (H), Medium (M), Low (L)                              |

Scope:
- Local Security Context (Unchanged)
- Entire Security Context (Changed) - more of a risk

## Temporal Metrics
- Exploit Code Maturity
- Remediation level
- Report Confidence

## Environmental Metrics
Based on the environment it can modify base metrics

# Vulnerability Reports
- [!note] Exception Management
#exception_management
A defined process to closely monitor systems that cannot be patched or remediated and must be excepted from scans

## Validate the report
Techniques to validate reports
- Repeat the scan
- Use different scan types
- Use different sensitivities
- Use a different scanner

Validate results
- *Reconcile* Results: scanners can misinterpret the info they receive from probes
- *Correlate* results with other sources
- *Compare* to best practices: find out the risk associated
- Identify *exceptions*: accepted or transferred risks

# Nessus
Plugins are made based on NASL
NASL #nasl: Nessus Attack Scripting Language

# OpenVAS and Qualys
## OpenVAS
#openvas #open_vas
OpenVAS began its development from Nessus codebase

## Qualys
#qualys
a cloud-based vulnerability management solution with installed sensor agents at various points in their network and the sensors upload data to the cloud platform for analysis

# Assessing Scan Outputs
