# Identifying Vulnerabilities
## steps
1. Collect a set of target attributes
2. Analyze the differences between current results and the past
3. Report the results

## Prioritize

# Scanning Workflow
## Questions to ask
- Who
- When
- Which systems
- Impact on systems
- Does a system need to be isolated during scanning
- Who can assist with scanning

## steps
1. Install software and patches to establish baseline
2. Perform initial scan of the target
3. Analyze the assessment report based on the baseline
4. Patch and fix the issues
5. Scan again to make sure issues been resolved
6. Document findings and create reports
7. Conduct ongoing scanning

# Scope Considerations
## Web application vulnerability scanners
e.g. **Nikto** #nikto analyze applications for SQL injection #sql_injection, XSS #xss, ...
## Infrastructure vulnerability scanners
e.g. **Nessus** #nessus

### Scopes - Points to consider
1. Scan Scheduling
2. configure based on compliance objective
3. Rescan critical assets more often

## Internal vs External

# Scanner Types
## Active
Consider bandwidth and processor resources
## Passive
Using enumeration tool by intercepting network. Least impact on network, but smaller amount of info is retrieved 
> Use cases:
> - Threat hunting
> - High impact of active scanning
## Credentialed
## Non-credentialed
## Server-based
## Agent-based
Pros
- Saves *network bandwidth*
- reduces chance of *service outages*
- better for mobile devices, esp. if they're *offline* in many occasions
Cons
- agent based on *each OS*
- vulnerable to *malware*

### Hybrid solution
Use both server-based and agent-based scanning

# Scanning parameters
## Segmentation
## Firewall/IDS/IPS
# Scheduling and Constraints
Times to perform scanning
- Deployment of new or updated systems
- Identification of new vulnerabilities
- Following a security breach
- Regulatory or oversight requirement
- As regularly scheduled
## PAM (Privilege Access Management)
#pam #privilege_access_management
mitigates the risk of an insider threat
## Restricted log-on hours
if using PAM is not possible

# Vulnerability Feeds
#nessus #plugin #openvas #open_vas #nvt
In *Nessus* called **Plugin**
In *OpenVAS* called **NVT**
## SCAP
Security Content Automation Protocol
#scap #security_content_automation_protocol #nist
a NIST framework that outlines various accepted practices for automating vulnerability scanning by adhering to standards for scanning processes, results reporting and scoring, and vulnerability prioritization
### OVAL
Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language
#oval #open_vulnerability_and_assessment_language
*XML* schema for describing *system security state* and *querying vulnerability reports and info*
### XCCDF
Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format
#xccdf #Extensible_configuration_checklist_description_format
*XML* schema for *developing* and *auditing* best-practice **configuration checklists** and **rules**

# Scan Sensitivity
Types of scan
## Discovery Scan
## Fast/Basic Assessment Scan
## Full/Deep Scan
Use more plugins than fast/basic scan
Ignores previous results
## Compliance Scan
> [!tip] Exam tip
Based on a template for a regulatory body e.g. *PCI DSS* which requires a **quarterly** scan

# Scanning Risks
More vulnerable to crashing while scanning
- printers
- VoIP phones
- embedded systems

Protect the results

Use a service account for credentialed scans
