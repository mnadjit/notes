# Enterprise Security Architecture
ESA  #esa , applies to the following
- IT governance
- IT service management (ITSM) #itsm

Frameworks under ESA provide the following:
- Policies
- Checklists
- Activities
- Technologies to use

## Frameworks
- ITIL
- COBIT
- TOGAF
- ISO 20000
- PCI DSS
- HIPAA

# Prescriptive Frameworks
Prescriptive = Mandatory
- A framework that stipulates control selection and deployment

## Maturity Model
a component of an ESA framework used to assess the formality and optimization of a security control selection and usage, and address any gaps
1. **Initial** - very reactive
2. **Managed** - prepare to mitigate through risk assessments
3. **Defined** - defined policies and procedures
4. **Quantitatively Managed**
5. **Optimizing**

# Risk-based Frameworks
a framework that uses risk assessment to prioritize security control selection and investment

This approach allows businesses to decide for themselves what risks they face and how to deal with them 
## NIST CSF
A Risk-Informed model
### Framework Core
1. Identify
2. Protect
3. Detect
4. Respond
5. Recover
### Implementation Tiers
How each of the 5 core functions are integrated with the org's overall risk management process. Each tier is classed as 
- **Partial**: low on he scale
- **Risk Informed**:
- **Repeatable**
- **Adaptive**: high on the scale
### Framework profiles
Capture a baseline of CS posture, set a goal and move towards it

# Audits and Assessments
## Quality Control and Assurance
#qc #qa
- **QC**: process of determining whether a system is free from defects or deficiencies
- **QA**: processes that analyze what constitutes quality and how it can be measured and checked

> [!tip] QA contains QC and other components

## Verification and Validation
- **Verification** is part of QC. To make sure something *does what it's supposed to do*
- **Validation**: process of determining whether the security system is *fit for purpose*
In ITIL *fit for purpose* is referred to as *utility*
## Assessments and Evaluations
- **Assessment**: testing in a structured way, with *checklist*
- **Evaluation**: *less methodic* than assessment
## Audits
More rigid than assessment or evaluation
Usually done in highly regulated industries to make sure *standards* are met
## Scheduled Reviews and Continual Improvement
Similar to lessons-learned review but on a regular basis
Consider:
- Major incidents
- Trends and analysis
- changes and additions
- progress made during the previous period
## Continual Improvement
Methods:
### 6 Sigma

### Deming Cycle
#deming_cycle #pdca_cycle

### Lean
#lean_method
![[Lean_Method.png|400]]
### Seven-step improvement (ITIL)
#itil_seven_step #seven_step_itil
![[ITIL_7_Step_Method.png|400]]
# Continuous Monitoring
Benefits:
- Situational Awareness
- Routine Audits
- Realtime Analysis

## CDM
#cdm #continuous_diagnostics_and_mitigation
Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation
provides US government agencies and departments with tools to identify risks on an ongoing basis
*CDM Components*
1. Dashboard
2. Asset Management
3. Identity and access management
4. Network security management
5. Data protection management
